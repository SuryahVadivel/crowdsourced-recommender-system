Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Reviewed by ovaltine from Indiana 4.94 /5 rDev +2.3% look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5 Pours the purest black color you’ve ever seen, swallowing all light in its path, and sporting a substantial, creamy mocha colored head that lingers and leaves a bracelet of a ring around the glass as you enjoy the beer.  An absolutely gorgeous BA impy stout. The nose is led by a decadent maple aroma, with roasty coffee notes following along with fudge brownie aromas triggering the salivary glands, and a bit of whiskey added in for good measure.  I am literally drooling. The maple is forward on the taste as well and quite delicious - and it is the least conspicuous flavor, with that fudge brownie flavor shining through SOOOO rich before it yields to the balance of the roasty coffee flavor so as not to become cloying - and then it’s all topped off by the whiskey at the back of the palate for a welcome bit of heat  and even more balance.  Truly astounding flavor profile. The mouthfeel is rich, full, and chewy like the aforementioned fudge brownie.  Spectacular.  This is the #1 rated beer on this website for a reason, and it’s now my #1 rated beer as well.  The absolute best, IMHO. Feb 22, 2025 Report",4.94
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Reviewed by Vainvoid 4.98 /5 rDev +3.1% look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5 This beer is intense, and yet, it feels very smooth. The chocolate notes are strong, accompanied by a touch of coffee that blend together perfectly to provide an equally excellent scent and flavor. I'm not the biggest fan of stouts, but this one absolutely deserves all the praise it gets. Feb 22, 2025 Report",4.98
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Reviewed by Beersnake from California 4.43 /5 rDev -8.3% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5 2022 vintage poured at fridge temp but tasted after it warmed in the glass for 15 minutes. Pours a very thick black with almost no head. The nose is pretty crazy. Maple syrup, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and vanilla. The taste is less sweet than suggested by the nose. The coffee really comes through here. Maple, burnt vanilla, salted toffee, fudge, biscuits, and a very slight roasty note. The body is pretty amazing. Thick and viscous. Goes down like a thick chocolate milk. The aftertaste is burnt toffee and coffee. The finish is super long. The alcohol is not really detectable. Is this the best beer I have ever tasted? Definitely not. Is it fantastic? Absolutely. Dec 25, 2024 Report",4.43
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Reviewed by John_M from Washington 4.61 /5 rDev -4.6% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5 Sampled at the brewery, this is the 2022 bottle version. The beer pours a viscous, blackish brown color with light brownish lacing and good head retention.  This beer pours like motor oil, and has the look of a beer that has seen some serious barrel aging (which I assume it has).   The nose is rich and decadent, showcasing maple syrup, dark chocolate, chocolate brownie, vanilla, light coffee and noticeable bourbon.  This smells like it might be pretty good, albeit very sweet and rich.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with the maple syrup, vanilla and bourbon taking center stage.  This beer is very sweet with quite a bit of maple flavor, which is perhaps its only flaw.  Mouthfeel is very full, with a long, soft finish.  The beer comes across as very viscous on the palate. Carbonation is fairly low, which I think works well with the mouthfeel in this beer.  The finish in this beer goes on forever.  Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though the abv is actually relatively low for a ba stout these days.  In any event, while you can tell the abv is up there in this beer, there's no heat or off flavors from the alcohol. Obviously, this is an excellent BA impy stout.  Does is justify the hype and price tag?  Can't answer that.  Depends on the consumer I suppose.  All I'll say is that it's a a very good beer and one I'm happy to have tried.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Reviewed by GreenBayBA from Wisconsin 4.7 /5 rDev -2.7% look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5 Perfect black color. I didn't see much foam, other than a brown ring. The smell is a perfect blend of maple, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. The taste is strong with maple. Almost too strong. Chocolate follows, with coffee, bourbon, and vanilla. It is very sweet. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth, lucious, and full. Very nice. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, but there is too much maple flavor for it to be one of my favorite beers. Dec 09, 2023 Report",

Its looks, smells, tastes, a 5,  HOWEVER, the mouth feel is NOT BY ANY MEANS EQUAL TO LOOK SMELL AND TASTE.  Pardon me i have to sit down.  Mouth feel is, well 11.  Yeh, like twice as good as anything ive ever had before.  It grabs you by the face with both hands and says, 'what was that that just went down my throat'.  It tasted familiar-- like real, pure butter on real Belgium-chocolate, buttermilk pancakes with fresh highbush blueberries, real Vermont maple syrup and Madagascar vanilla, served with Seattle coffee, and a shot of pappy.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Reviewed by Emichaelbray from Pennsylvania 3.79 /5 rDev -21.5% look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75 So I just read a review that called the legendary KBBS, “typical…white trash.” It kinda made me nervous because I don’t dig white/pale stouts and I thought, “how could I miss that this being a white stout?!” Well happily that guy is drinking something else. Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares? So KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too. The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care. After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful. Given the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant. Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly  think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one… Mar 11, 2022 Report",3.79
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Reviewed by Rug from Massachusetts 4.65 /5 rDev -3.7% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75 2021 vintage, bottle #79 Holy. Fucking. Shit. KBBS. Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh? Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacing The nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbon Man, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. Sublime A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetness I won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one. More than the sum of its parts. Cheers BA! Feb 26, 2022 Report",4.65
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Reviewed by Pru from Massachusetts 4.27 /5 rDev -11.6% look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.25 Celebrating my buddy @Rug with his 1,000th beer review. Pours an almost perfect black with no head. Smells lightly of maple syrup and chocolate. With the first sip I immediately tasted chocolate and caramel followed by a maple syrup finish. The syrup flavor lingers. The feel department is where this stout lacks. Feels very light, which is good for me as someone not too fond of stouts and lagers but to the avid fan of a heavier beer, this one may disappoint. Overall great beer and I’m glad I got to crack it open with my bud. Feb 26, 2022 Report",4.27

Medium bodied, perfect carbonation. Not too thin nor too thick. Overall: a standard BA breakfast stout. Great beer overall but over hyped with ridiculous pricing.

This is my first of any Dark Lord variant, and I think it’s a damn good place to start for the series. Let’s pop this legend open and see what it has to offer Pours almost completely pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing The roast is real in this one, but it’s wonderfully offset by the sweeter notes as well. I’m picking up on aromas of drip coffee, burnt caramel, dark toast, milk chocolate, tobacco, vanilla bean, molasses, toasted oak, fig, and light cinnamon It’s similar in taste, but with even more of a depth, making this one hell of a complex beer. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, vanilla bean, sweetened coffee, toasted oak, fig, maple syrup, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, black cherry, and marshmallow.

Heavy oily legs form on the glass after a swirl. Aroma is marshmallow and brown sugary initially. This overt sugariness breaks away to reveal roasty and toasty malts with a hearty bitter edge. Underneath is bourbon and late barrel character, which further counteract the initial sugary notes. Flavor profile pushes the same start - marshmallow and brown sugar, in addition to toffee. As these start-up notes fade, hearty barrel, bourbon, and roasty and toasty malts are revealed. The latter hearty notes becomes the storyline the second half, countering the initial sugary notes well. Mouth feel is thick, with a velvety, smooth, and full texture. Overall, while the sugary start leads to a dangerous territory, the following malt and barrel notes balance the whole experience out well. Served from a 750mL bottle. Light blue wax.

Now doubling down with a vanilla-riddled, bourbon barrel aged version of that notorious elixir has allowed time to finally catch up with it. With a thick, oily and onyx looking pour, Marshmallow Hanjee shares barely a trickle of froth before falling still. As its decadent scent of vanilla drifts gently above its sweet and savory roast, the scent of espresso, cocoa and nuttiness permeates an oxidized aroma of sherry, port and soy. Devilishly sweet, the beer's early cloying nature saturates the early palate with molasses, sorghum, vanilla cream and all-things burnt marshmallows. As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a full and lavish saturation of the tastebuds reveal bold complementary flavors of espresso, bittersweet chocolate, white chocolate, sweet wines and savory sherry, port and madeira. Hinting toward soy sauce, a late and whisky soaked taste of bourbon keeps the complex flavors of coconut, caramel, toasted oak and bourbon spice coming sip after sip. Heavy, rich and undeniably cloying, the sipping ale is oily and warm on the palate, reserved as an after dinner digestif. A long, rich and fat maltiness clings to the mouth for an impossibly long and spicy aftertaste. Dec 27, 2021 Report",4.59

Nose is huge notes of dark bar chocolate, chocolate cordials, Mexican chocolate with light bourbon and barrel notes off the bat. Initially, this comes across as a rich dessert beer, but it doesn't feel overwhelmingly sweet or otherwise extra in any regard. If anything, the bourbon notes are very subtle, particularly compared to other beers within the style. As it warms, some more savory notes - dark soy sauce and mole - start to open up. Taste is equally balanced with its sweetness. Up front are chocolate covered cherries, semi-sweet chocolate, Australian black licorice, Kahlua; pepper comes through on the back end and melds with the warming alcohol notes. Very little trace of booze in here, and the finish is has some interesting caramel notes. Mouthfeel is predictably chews and full, almost akin to a BCBS. Overall, this was super enjoyable and balanced, and the peppers give it some subtle warmth that's really pleasant. With that said, the sweetness came across a little flat to me, while the bourbon and barrel are a little underwhelming. Given the rarity of this beer vs. the increasing ubiquity of the standard Abraxas, I don't see much reason to reach for this bottle instead of the base beer. Jan 01, 2025 Report",4.34
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by DokiDokiLitFam from New Jersey 4.78 /5 rDev +1.1% look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75 Man is this brew good...I've been wanting to try this for years. Ever since I had original Abraxas back in 2020, I've been pining to get my hands on this bottle. As for looks, its your standard fare for a 14% Stout. Dark and thick looking with little to no foam to speak of. Some legs on the side of the glass, but it doesn't look too sticky appearance wise. Nose is freaking superb. Oak, chocolate, cinnamon, bourbon, roasted malt that typically reminds me of street cart style pretzel, dark fruit like fig as it warms. Very mild ethanol presence which is crazy all things considered. Taste is nearly as good as the nose. The roasted malt, chocolate, and cinnamon come together in a decadent fashion. Like malted milk ball and cinnamon ice cream, but not as sweet. I think the peppers have been hidden by the barrel aging. They manifest as heat on the back of the throat, but not so much as flavor. The slight issue I have with this is the astringency from the barrel aging. Sometimes the barrel, the roasted malt, and the ethanol come together and create an almost soapy taste and feel. It's very silght but it still exists on the mid palate where you want the flavors to crescendo a little more harmoniously. Mouthfeel is great as well. Thick, smooth, silky, and almost fluffy. Not too cloying or oily. Some of that tannin astringency emerges as well, but not offensive. Very mild alcohol burn. Yeah, this is the real deal. Pretty much as close to perfection as a brew can get. I don't believe in an objective perfect beer, because if you strengthen one aspect you might inevitably weaken another. But this one shows true skill and care in mastering a craft. Rated #5 on this website for a reason. Sep 14, 2024 Report",4.78

Another milestone calls for yet another infamous beer. I had the base beer a few years back and thought it was damn good, but this one is supposed to be so much better. How much better? The base beer is currently sitting at #244 overall on BA and this barrel aged variant sits at a whopping #5 overall. Alright, let’s dive right into this beast Pours completely pitch black with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing Surprisingly this is rather gentle in the nose. I expected more of a bite between the adjuncts and barrel aging but I really like this approach. I'm picking up on aromas of cacao nib, molasses, sweet bourbon, vanilla bean, dried chili, red grape, toasted oak, maple syrup, and light cinnamon There's more bite to it in taste but it never becomes overwhelming, it's very nicely balanced. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting cacao nib, chili powder, earthy cinnamon, vanilla bean, raisin, smooth oak, burnt caramel, earthy bourbon, light molasses, and cherry pit. The swallow brings notes of cacao nib, vanilla bean, chili powder, earthy cinnamon, charred oak, chocolate fudge, cherry pit, red grape, earthy bourbon, light maple syrup, and walnut A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a chewy beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks below its abv Ironically, this ended up getting the same exact score from me as the base beer. Trying them side by side might be a different story, but I just wasn't blown away by this. Great, but not world class May 11, 2024 Report",4.49

The beer pours fairly dark, blackish brown color with good head retention and considerable lacing.  The beer certainly looks impressive enough.  On the nose, I pick up vanilla, green chili peppers, some chocolate, underlying coffee and considerable whiskey.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though I thought it a bit hot on the finish (something that is especially noticeable, given the chili flavor in this beer).  That being said, the barrel aging seems to mute the base beer flavors in this beer somewhat, and really doesn't seem to blend in all that well.  It does add another flavor component/dimension, which is always nice, but the whiskey flavor otherwise doesn't seem to bring a lot to the party in this beer.  Mouthfeel is fairly full otherwise, and the alcohol seemed to be pretty well integrated into the flavor profile.  Drinkability is pretty good, though it's hard to imagine drinking more than a small amount of this beer at a sitting. This is a very nice beer, but given it's reputation, I confess I was expecting a bit more from it.  Very glad I had the opportunity to try it, but this probably isn't a beer I'd want to seek out again. Mar 18, 2022 Report",4.31

It has been my most cherished beer in my cellar for a few years now.  After a while, I decided last night that I can't let this one just sit around and collect dust any longer!!! A: A very rich, dark purple with a light pink head. S: I not only smelt the two glasses I poured, I also spent a good 5 minutes with my nose practically inside the top of the bottle.  That is how amazing this smells.  Pure unripened, tart blackberry juice is the best way I can describe this.  You can almost assume what this will taste like just by smell alone.  I am happy that nothing was lost in terms of aroma from this being a few years old. T: A present, but not overly tartness comes through but the most important flavor here is the blackberry.  I said to my friend that this is like eating a blackberry when its still firm and tart, before it becomes mushy and sweet.  Fresh blackberry jam would also be a great comparison.  The flavor is perfect in every way and I am so happy this lived up to the hype and did not diminish in any way over time.  I love this beer! M: A full, but not too thick mouthfeel.  Perfect. O: Well, having had some amazing sour offerings from Russian River, Lost Abbey, Cantillon, Hill Farmstead, Side Project, Jester King and many more, I can safely say that this is the best sour I've ever had and my new favorite.  I didn't think anything could outclass Framboise du Fermier, but this beer is so well balanced and has too much flavor to have any competition.  THIS IS THE PINNACLE OF SOUR BEER.

This smells like heavy roast, pepper spice, rum spice, cocoa powder, oak, dark fruit, smoke, and espresso. Both barrels don't necessarily come through here - it's more smokey rum than anything else. I'm not sure I actually get any apple brandy. There's a decent amount of pepper, and a touch of cinnamon, and a definite big helping of chocolate. There's some tobacco and smoke too, as is kind of common with this brewery. There's a touch of molasses syrup on the back end, too. This is medium bodied, with a decent creaminess, and no real booziness, with a slightly bitter/syrupy finish. This isn't anywhere near the height of the hype it (used to) get, but it's still enjoyable in a vacuum. Nov 09, 2019 Report",4.09

It was not nasty black licorice, since it was balanced by chocolate syrup, coconut, and dry green apple. My disappointment was that the pepper spice of the base beer was gone. There was a hint of cinnamon, but little heat. The barrel notes become more pronouned as it warms, particularly the apple brandy.

Those flavors smack of orange, grapefruit, and pine pretty heavily with twinges of grass and herb.

Showcase for what a Double IPA should be. The cleanest hoppiness, but still firm and lingering.

Bought fresh from the brewery in Vermont several 4-packs and have been keeping them in the refrigerator since. Heady Topper is exceptionally well balanced and exceptionally delicious. It pours slightly hazy and a straw yellow color. It has a very pleasant aroma, but what floors you is the FLAVOR. It's a little bit bitter, but not exceptionally so...  There is the piney, resinous flavor associated with west coast IPAs, but there is that flavor perhaps of marijuana (I've never had that), as the brewer claims. The result is a mind-bending intense, delicious beer drinking experience, unlike any other. The aftertaste lingers on the the tongue for minutes afterwards between drinks. I believe that this beer is the one that opened the door to the New England IPA style.  The idea that putting the flavoring hops at the end of the boil, rather than boiling out all of the wonderful aromatics, is the way to go! The water, the yeast, the hops, and the malt all combine in perfect harmony whose result is simply an extremely flavorful, but also extremely delicious beer! In the summer, I found some on the shelf at a liquor store here in Connecticut. But it was ten months old and had not been refrigerated. And it was not nearly this good.  The hops had lost their punch. To really get the proper experience with this beer, you need fresh beer, which is what brewer John Kimmich tells us right on the can. ""This beer is perishable, and at it's best when it is young, fresh, and hazy. Keep it cold, but not ice cold. Drink this beer immediately. We are always making more."" - John Kimmich.

Heady Hopper is not only moderate for the style, but knows what moderate means (too few micros know what means.) Heady Looks inviting, nice foam and lace.  After not following the ritual, I poured my can into a glass and Smells were even more good; albeit not what the brewmaster recommends.

I always pour my beers but since the can instructs one to drink directly from the can I only poured after several ounces from the can.  After doing both the difference, at least for me, was that I found the hops were more pronounced, sharper and were more tart. Now for the pour. LOOK: Pours a fairly light pale straw. Very little haze, until I emptied the can at which time any clarity had disappeared. The pour had rising carbonation and an all-white 2 finger head that is as persistent as any beer I have ever encountered. The side glass lace is also prominent. AROMA: Some mild citrus hops from the glass, stronger from the can. Wet Malts also evident. TASTE: The citrus tastes come in the form of mango, pineapple and melon. None are too strong and just nicely balanced with malts that make this masterpiece a memorable experience. This is a beer that will attain the highest rating of the now 835+ I have reviewed.

KJ is sweeter than Julius which I like and gives you a big punch of grapefruit and orange. The hops in my opinion work much better with the sweeter KJ malt backbone than Julius. The mouthfeel is top notch as expected with a soft feel to the beer. Is it the best IPA I’ve ever had? No, but it’s definitely in my top 10. Jun 22, 2025 Report",
King Julius,"Reviewed by NeroFiddled from Pennsylvania 4.43 /5 rDev -5.7% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Tree House Brewing Co. ""King Julius"" 16 fl. oz. can coded ""THE RETURN OF THE KING  5.12.2025"" and sampled on 5.27.2025 $20/4-pk at the brewery on May 15, 2025 Notes via stream of consciousness: So is this just a bigger version of their standard Julius? I would imagine so but I don't know. It's poured a cloudy orange body beneath a slightly yellowed off-white head. The aroma is citrusy and sweetish with some added floral character, a bit of peach, and a touch of hop resin. The taste follows with a soft, sweetish malt base that's lightly bready and oaty. Fruity hop notes include orange, nectarine, mango, and pineapple.  There's also some hop resins and a bit of alcohol. How strong is this? Ahhh, it's 8.2% ABV so a little bit of alcohol is expected. I happen to have a can of Julius on hand and in a side by side comparison I do believe that this is simply an amped up version. With my first sip I thought that perhaps I preferred the King Julius because it's maltier, sweeter, and just bigger all around but it didn't take long for me to realize that the original Julius is a really incredible beer in its own right, and my favorite between the two. In the mouth the king is full bodied, and gently crisp and creamy smooth. Looking at both of the glasses in front of me it appears that the Julius has a better lacing to it, but that's also to be expected because alcohol hurts both head retention and lacing and the King Julius is 8.2% whereas the Julius is 6.8%. In the end, thinking only about the King Julius, it's an exceptional double IPA that's taken the ""juicy NEIPA"" baton and run it straight to the finish line. It's massively flavorful and yet not overdone, really well balanced, superbly rounded, and stunningly easy to drink for a beer of 8.2% ABV. Superb! Review #9,228 May 27, 2025 Report",4.43

King Julius,"Reviewed by JohnG190 from New York 5 /5 rDev +6.4% look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5 Appearance: King Julius pours a stunning, hazy orange-gold, reminiscent of freshly pressed mango juice. The beer’s turbidity is characteristic of the New England IPA style, with no hint of clarity. A thick, creamy, off-white head forms upon pouring, clinging to the glass as it slowly dissipates, leaving intricate lacing patterns. Aroma: The nose is an explosion of tropical fruits and citrus, showcasing mango, pineapple, passion fruit, and orange juice. Subtle notes of peach, apricot, and a touch of resinous pine add complexity. A faint sweetness, reminiscent of honey or ripe stone fruits, rounds out the aroma. Each inhale invites you to anticipate a juicy, fruit-forward experience. Palate: On the palate, King Julius delivers on the promise of its aroma. Juicy mango, pineapple, and tangerine dominate, complemented by hints of papaya and melon. There’s a soft bitterness that balances the sweetness, with earthy undertones of pine and herbal notes emerging mid-sip. The malt backbone is restrained but provides a subtle sweetness that supports the massive hop presence without overshadowing it. The beer finishes with a clean, fruity linger, making each sip as enticing as the first. Mouthfeel: King Julius has a luscious, creamy mouthfeel that feels like silk on the palate. It’s medium-bodied with moderate carbonation, which enhances the beer’s smoothness and drinkability. The softness and slight chewiness of the beer create an almost nectar-like quality, perfectly suited to the juicy hop profile. Overall Impression: King Julius is a masterclass in the New England IPA style, balancing intense fruitiness, soft bitterness, and impeccable mouthfeel. The beer’s vibrant appearance and lush aromas immediately draw you in, while its juicy, tropical flavors and creamy texture deliver a drinking experience that’s both bold and approachable. It’s no surprise that King Julius is considered one of the finest examples of the style, a beer that lives up to its royal name in every sense. Jan 11, 2025 Report",
King Julius,"Reviewed by Porter1312 from Massachusetts 4.72 /5 rDev +0.4% look: 2.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75 Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip. It pours a immensly hazy dark mustard yellow with a bubbly off-white head that leaves perfect streaking around the glass. Aroma is fruit forward: orange zest, pineapple, and juniper before a crisp “dank” turpine note. On the pallate I can best describe this as a juice bomb. Just a cacophany of flavor: tangerine, pineapple, tropical fruits like guava, and peach gives way to a pine note and soft dank notes before a ever-so-kind hop bite that dries that pallette. Mouthfeel is ideal: medium body with a mellow front, a nice amount of carbonation and a kind hoppy bite. Overall, fantastic release from Treehouse. Cheers! Jan 09, 2025 Report",4.72

For my self I’d like to think this is a very top end NEIPA vs IPA. Having had King JJJuliusss and Julius on tap at TH… this seemed like a unique great brew somewhere between the 2. Not surprising but no less wonderful. Pour produced rich plumy white head which dissipated fairly quickly with little lacing but a decent thin halo. Nose is pleasant fruit…mangoes and straw. Taste brought in orange but creamy not pushy citrus. Likewise the other fruits in the base malt/hops combination had a creamsicle vs raw fruit taste. I found it inviting and excellent. There was residual resin on back end that worked. Overall a superb easy tasty orange creamsicle with some mango, papaya and passion fruit with a complimentary mild dank. Body was very smooth, slightly thin for DIPA… and supported by a some medium bright soft carb. Again a big complex and delicious brew that seems like a great NEIPA. It does not nor need to be considered a DIPA considering all the examples then/now from other excellent breweries. I found this less complex nor or taste; not as big/ full but considerably more tasty than King JJJuliusss I had earlier this evening. Definitely what I could say is the King Julius is one of the …if not the best NEIPA… I’ve had for those brews that are full tropical plus dank. Highly enjoyed. Grateful to have tried.

Good amount of malt to tie things together. F - medium, leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Soft, very smooth. Juicy O - It's such a different beer from other tree house NEIPAs due to its smoothed out hop profile. The hops are present but there is no bitterness or abrasiveness at all, combined with the very present citrus - mainly orange and tangerine - and tropical fruit notes - mango and pineapple, make this a very smooth, yet somewhat subdued beer.

Very opaque and cloudy yellow orange with a flash of a white head and ton of carbonation on the side. The sip is like something illicitly good. The immediate nanosecond of a sip you can tell what's about to happen. It's opulently smooth and you want more before you even when you haven't finished a mouthful yet. The description is apt in that any bitter or abrasiveness has been completely tamed and just bows down to what your taste buds want to hear: smooth tropical juice. Anything counter to that smoothness has been surgically excised. It's very strong and extremely smooth for the ABV with no noticeable alcohol save for some build up of heat while drinking. It's interesting because there is still some level of hop fire but it's extremely smooth and pleasant. It's great. May 12, 2024 Report",4.77

Can is dated 03/13/24. Received from @Roguer in NBS BIF #18. Pours...beyond murky. Slurry? Big head, fluffy, lots and lots of carbonation. Head settles into dense cottony piles. Kind of a singed orange color. Smell is big orange and tropical notes -- mango/papaya more than pineapple. Clear citrus rind hop character lurking conspicuously in the background. Taste: the lean toward citrus rind hop character and away from mango/papaya juicy notes surprises me. More juice comes out, leaning toward orange, kind of early in the taste. But, it sure does clobber you with resin on the back-end, without losing the bright fruit character. Mango skin bitterness start to finish, too. Mouthfeel is big, hefty without being too thick, a little bit of a pillowy feel. Definite chalky texture. Overall, this is a very nice beer. Apr 12, 2024 Report",4.34

The head has an incredible level of retention, very slowly fading over time and leaving a massive amount of foamy and streaky lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – A gigantic amount of tangerine and orange greet the nose, along with big aromas of tropical fruits of pineapple and papaya.  Other big hop smells of grapefruit and herb are there as well, mixed with a big showing of a very raw and green hop smell, pungent like a raw hop nugget.  Notes of yeast and a bit of lemon mix in there as well, and with a bready and slightly doughy malt smell, a very fruity and inviting aroma is produced overall. Taste – The taste begins much drier than one would anticipate from the nose.  It starts with a moderately bready flavor mixed with lots of tangerine and grapefruit as well as a big showing of orange and mango.  Right from the start the hop is ever present with a good showing of a smooth grapefruit hop mixed with lots of raw herbal and earthy hop flavors.  The hop is fresh tasting, almost like biting into a hop nugget, melding well with the other flavors nicely.  Toward the end, there is a touch of hay and grass, as well as a bit of lemon and an increase in the tropical fruits with a bit of pineapple joining in.  The flavor transitions that transpire lead to a nice somewhat more raw and dankly hopped, but smooth taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is rather thick and chewy with a carbonation level that is slightly more subdued.  For the rich hop flavors the feel is fantastic making for a nice easy slow and flavorful sipper. Overall – A well renowned beer for a reason.  It is damn good.  While not the number 1 IPA for me, it was very flavorful, hoppy, smooth, and balanced; a blend that is difficult to attain.  Well done. Oct 24, 2023 Report",4.44

Pliny The Younger,"Reviewed by JohnniEMc from Pennsylvania 4.8 /5 rDev +2.3% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75 The first thing that stands out is how ordinary this looks. It's a bright light amber color with a modest white head. Served in a clear half pint glass from a tap in Philadelphia, at first glance, one would wonder about all the fuss. The aroma is mildly piney, again there's no reason to get too excited. Then, to taste it and realize what all the acclaim is about. It is dry hop dominate, but there is a substantial malt backbone. It manages to provide a nice malt counterbalance without becoming too sweet, nor earthy. The substantial hop bite is piney, but dry and incredibly clean. There's little lacing inside the glass and there's even less notice of the 10.25% ABV. This deserves its reputation as among the best. Feb 24, 2023 Report",

Aroma: Sweet earthy piney notes, mild and pleasant tropical fruits and pine resin. Rich Bready malts. Taste: citrus and tropical fruit, makes way for a balance of pine, herbal, and floral hops. Slightly boozie toward the end. Some sweetness balanced with a good, strong bitter finish gives it best of both worlds. Overall opinion:  this is an amazing beer. It lives up to the hype. Very hoppy, but it isn't all up in your face about it. It's like a smooth sailing Hoppy adventure on your pallet. Both the aroma and the taste has some incredible complexity. I give it 5 out of 5.

I rarely seem to see, smell, taste, feel a beer as described by the brewery. Nothing wrong just unlikely to evaluate a beer exactly the same. But for King JJJuliusss… I completely agree…and with others reviewing. Crazy. This is a superb IPA. Poured a beautiful plumy snowy white head on a bed of golden orange accented straw. Hazy but not murky when held to light. No particulates despite a huge malty yeasty brew. Characteristic dissipation of the head considering ABV. But lovely residual lacing and thin halo. Nose is as described…Mango, Orange and Grapefruit. Slight grass and dank. Slightly when cold, but wonderfully complex marriage of malts and hops as beer opened and warmed. Taste mirrors if even more fruit flavors and juiciness…and to borrow a comment from “jw13”’s review…a “rindy” bitterness…vs a resiney  bitterness. Perfect description. Can’t find any downside to body…full, smooth ; some bright carbonation( but adds a refreshing quality to the big beer vs a distracting burn). Best of both worlds. Overall, just about a perfect NEDIPA. Worth noting that nose at last @25% of pour literally exploded. The scent was rich and so complex. Wood, malts, banana coming out …softly expanding a resonation of so many scents playing together…where the sensation became even more interesting. It surpassed the taste. Never experienced that before. Then body became slightly less heavy, and even less carb brightness. It was now almost like a hand pulled cask. Wow. King Julius is next… but just can’t figure how this will better King JJJuliusss. At least for me. Sep 01, 2024 Report",4.82

The head has a great level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving spiderweb lacing all over the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is huge of an orange rind smell mixed with sweet notes of tangerine and orange as well as plenty of herbal hops and a strong showing of pine and earth. Mixed with thee smells are some juicy pineapple, mango, and papaya with some citrus hop smell with a ruby red grapefruit.  Other citrus notes of lemon and lime as well as some bready malt and light grain are there as well, mixing in with some raw hop smells to produce a rather dank and green hoppy smell overall. m Taste – The taste begins with a thick bready malt flavor that is composed mostly of a smooth wheat, doughy, and oaty flavor.  There is also a moderately sizable fruit flavor upfront, with orange and peach being the strongest, but with notes of pear and apple and a hint of lemon in there as well.  The hop is strong from the start as well, with a earthy and herbal hop being the most pronounced followed by some notes of pine and floral hops.  As the taste advances the pine and herb grown stronger while the earth fades, bringing more dankness to the tongue.  That said the sweetness picks up a tad, balancing out the hops rather well, and with some very raw hop and grassy flavors coming on at the end, one is left with a dank, but sweeter and malty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate to higher carbonation level.  Quite nice for the thick and dank tastes of the brew and certainly makes for a nice slow sipper. Overall –A quite nice and tasty brew with a lot of hop attitude, but a balanced demeaner.  While not quite up to the hype, it is certainly a well crafted brew. Aug 29, 2023 Report",4.39

I could not imagine a beer looking any darker or more foreboding than this one. In the glass, the liquid appeared shimmery and dense, like used motor oil. The body was topped by a thin, finely beaded, caramel colored crown that quickly dissolved. There was no lacing whatsoever. After each sip, a sticky brown film coated the sides of the glass. There was also an oily sheen atop the liquid, most likely from the oils in the coconut. The aroma was super boozy and bourbon forward. Initially, this smelled more like a spirit than a beer. Nice vanilla and coconut presence. The vanilla and coconut definitely seemed to be more a part of the bourbon barrel-aged base beer than a separate adjunct however. As the beer sat, more of the stout-like characteristics came forth. Big caramel and roasted malt presence. Loads of burnt sugar too. Some dark chocolate and dark fruit notes were also detectable. The toasted coconut and vanilla really intensified later. All in all, sweet and pastry like but not excessively so. The flavor profile was similar to the nose and also really intense. Roasted malts led things off up front. Good dose of caramel malt sweetness too. Super boozy, bourbon notes appeared soon as well and crescendoed as the beer moved along the palate. Loads of sweet coconut and vanilla in the center. More bourbon and alcohol heat on the back end and in the finish. I definitely felt the 15.5% ABV in this, but the sweetness and thick body really made the alcohol presence tolerable. Burnt caramel and roasted malts appeared on the back end. Nice melding of sweet caramel malts, roasted malt notes and alcohol heat in the lingering finish. The mouthfeel was also outstanding. Exceptionally dense and full bodied. The liquid felt uber rich and heavy on the palate and contained a finely beaded, moderate effervescence. My only knock on this was that the body could have been a bit more velvety and smooth. It was only fitting that I celebrated my 2350th beer review and, more importantly, the news that I was going to be a father for the second time with the second best rated beer in the world. Blessed is an exceptional barrel-aged pastry stout and one that features both its barrel character and its adjuncts prominently. Cheers to you, Ramona. Nov 08, 2024 Report",

Only the alcohol legs stand out aesthetically. The aroma, though, might be one of the most multi-faceted yet delicate experiences I've encountered in the beer world. There's just so much going on, yet the notes of bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, coconut, and almonds are so harmonious and perfectly balanced, it just blows my mind. The flavor profile absolutely doesn't disappoint in the slightest, and I gave the aroma a 5! A fuckin' 5! I don't hand out 5's the way Stone Cold Steve Austin hands out Stone Cold Stunners, that's for sure. It opens with a huge hit of coconut and vanilla, revealing a midtaste of dark fruit goodness. Oak gradually appears on the back end, with a perfectly balanced hit of booze to cleanse the palate. Despite the extreme flavors, it's shockingly balanced, though perhaps less delicate than the aroma; that's my only real nit to pick, and I wonder if it's even worth picking. The feel is just a touch flat, but despite the intense, palate coating sweetness, the oak tannins and nuanced alcohol presence do enough to cleanse the palate. In general, it's extreme but somehow well rounded...the best of both worlds. I don't regret spending $53 on this small bottle. Enough said. This right here - in my humble opinion - is a paragon of the beer world, and the best barrel aged stout I've ever sampled. Feb 03, 2024 Report",4.83

And then things in my life recently made me feel we should do what we can while we can, so maybe I should drink the highest ranked beer I have in my collection. It’s sweet, flavorful, balanced, and boozy. Dark, very brown edging, oil sheen top. Strong sweet notes of coconut, vanilla, toasted dark malt, and bourbon barrel so strong it can burn your nose hair. Taste is a duel between strong booze of the bourbon barrel and the sweetness of the coconut and vanilla. Feel is the weak point here. It’s maybe too much of a booze burn, and it’s a bit sticky and thick. I’m thinking aging it would have helped, and it’s my fault for that. But I wanted to try this beer, and I did. Glad I did. It’s big on flavor and booze and very enjoyable for the attempt. Above rating was I believe for 2022 or 2023. I’m definitely drinking 2023 tonight. Keeping it at 4.8. Excellent. Nov 22, 2023 Report",

Absolutely gorgeous imperial stout. I don’t know if the nose of a beer can be decadent, but this beer’s nose is, with rich cocoa and vanilla notes up front, some dark cherries, and a sledgehammer of oak and barrel notes. The taste is led by the vanilla and cocoa notes, and they are rich and chewy, moving into the dark cherry flavors to cut the sweetness a bit, and then finishing with the oak and a welcome boozy warming from the three bourbon barrels featured in this beer. The mouthfeel is as rich and decadent as a gooey bourbon soaked brownie sitting in a dip of vanilla ice cream.  I can’t imagine a more perfect rendering of a BA imperial stout.

Slumbering away for extended aging these three barrels give Anchorage Brewing a love child that can compete with the best. Jet black and pouring like inky tar, Blessed pours with a luscious, ominous and velvety pour. While shy on froth the overwhelming scent of molasses, chocolate, whisky, oak, coconut and cream align with stronger scents of coffee and campfire. Once on the tongue, the immense sweetness of molasses, brown sugar and fudge carry and nearly brownie-batter taste with those sweeter bourbon barrels playing a maple and coconut sweetness. As the sweeter flavors swirl on the tastebuds, notions of mound and almond joy pop off of the middle palate while the malts remain juicy and plush. Trailing into a smooth espresso, cappuccino character, the late taste brings out all of those coconut, toasted oak, vanilla, cherry and savory smoke to have the session trending warm, sultry and savory set of pleasantries. Full bodied, pillowy and fortified with nearly port-like proportions, the stout is simply magical. It pushes the boundaries in what is a fully malted imperial stout before pushing into the pastry realm. The warmth of whisky is soothed with caramel malts, vanilla and coconut and balances the sheer malts with utter ease. Jul 19, 2023 Report",4.83

I’m picking up on aromas of sticky caramel, thick fudge, toasted coconut, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, dates, light roast coffee, nougat, and a touch of maple While it is certainly good in taste, it doesn't quite reach the levels of the aroma, though there's still a lot going on. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting chocolate cake, black cherry, sweet coconut, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, and a touch of fudge.

S- The aroma explodes from the glass, with tremendously expressive notes of many different fruits! Huge notes of mulled apple cider, plum, prune, and red wine soaked raisins. Charred oak, sweet vanilla, leather, light tobacco, and warming booze come through more as it warms.

All of the aforementioned fruit notes follow, with the mulled apple cider and wine soaked raisins as the prominent players. Loads of sweet bourbon and vanilla finish this out beautifully! F- The mouthfeel is perfectly round, with absolutely no sharp edges despite the 20% abv! It is thick and viscous without being cloying at all. Somehow there is no alcohol heat, even in the finish.

Aroma is caramel, fig, toffee, raisin, molasses, and nutty, toasty, and roasty malts. Bourbon, deep oak, and char add even further to the depth. Candied sugar wraps it up. It reaches in every direction at once - sweet, hot, and bold - without ever feeling discombobulated or lacking direction. Flavor profile is molasses, caramel, fig, raisin, and toffee. Toasty and mild roasty malts add support and depth. Heavy bread comes on more as the beer warms. Smooth bourbon hits at the back, but engrained into the profile, not an afterthought. It creates an expressive profile of notes. Mouth feel is medium-thick despite the high alcohol content. It's still in texture, with just a light nep to the texture. Overall, a big, big, big time barleywine that does well to accent the barrel usage, but not enough to come across as a hot bourbon.

At times, it can be so difficult to address the true outcome of a beer when it is so heavily shrouded by hype. It’s no secret to the craft beer community that Side Project brewing boasts one of if not the best barrel program in the world. Even the likes of M.J.K., a beer representing the culmination of their barleywine production, finds it self constantly under scrutiny, for the most part by those who will never actually have a chance to try it themselves. Again provided with an incredibly rare opportunity to open yet another La Coterie exclusive bottle, M.J.K. was one in particular that I knew I had to savor. As denoted on the embossed description card that accompanied the beer in its laser engraved wooden box, the beer poured still. Dark and brooding in its deep brown coloration, the beige bubbles that sprouted up upon the pour quickly retreated back into the viscous, quickly motionless liquid. When a base barleywine is blended, rested, and finished in three separate mashes and incorporated together to highlight the shining components of each individual barrel’s notable characteristics, there’s two things you can count on. 1) This beer will take TIME to break down and really appreciate, and 2) the ABV will knock you on your ass. The complexity of M.J.K. is incredible;  you’re greeted immediately with rich, sweet toffee on the nose, a balance of caramelized sugar contrasted by a much more robust, slightly smoky molasses flavor. As that initial punch softens there’s a distinct yet brief softening on the palate, giving nostalgic flashbacks to endless dishes of your grandmother’s Werther’s caramel candies. That silky smooth, melted brown sugar essence is then quick to be replaced by one of the more welcome and recognizable flavor components in barleywine: the beloved raisin. Sweet, and just a touch leathery, it really helps to accent the potency of the barrel, a quality which, amazingly at 20% ABV, had taken a backseat during the period of time the liquid went from the glass along its journey towards the back of the throat. Charred oak, freshly processed vanilla, smoke, boot leather, and a touch of ethanol strike the back of the throat on the tail. While it’s a quick and forceful reminder of the gravity on this beer, it still didn’t appear to drink even remotely close to 20%. The smooth warmth of the alcohol and complexity of each individual component expertly integrated had M.J.K. going down the hatch like a 14-15% barrel-aged beer AT MOST. Now, all this seems a bit dramatic; a bit embellished. The goal is to take you through the steps of a beer that deserves every word of the breakdown. A complexity that SHOULD be highlighted in every facet. A beer that, in short, is well worthy of any and all hype it has received. Trust in Cory King and Side Project, especially when diving into a beer that they have explicitly labeled as the culmination of production in the given style. Let’s just say the surname fits.

M.J.K.,"Reviewed by Luscious_Malfoy from Illinois 4.79 /5 rDev -1.2% look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75 bottle pour at the brewery tasting room. dark brown with light brown edges. zero head. a few bubbles that fade away quickly. great legs on this on. runs down the side of the glass after a swig like a nice port wine. heavy whiskey sting on the nose with figs, plums, caramel, toffee and leather. hint of chocolate but it’s a little more toffee and caramel. taste follows with a rich toffee and caramel flavor backed by leather and dark fruits and a surprisingly subtle barrel presence on the finish when compared to the nose. full mouthfeel with, of course, no carb. interesting with the extended aging and bottled still. not as thick as i had hoped for but that does help the drinkability, which is too easy for 20%. exceptional barleywine!

Black Magick - Pappy Van Winkle,"Reviewed by Jeffo from Netherlands 3.99 /5 rDev -15.6% look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4 Got this one from claaark13 a while back. Big fan of the regular version so I was stoked to see these. Thanks a lot man! Appreciated. From a 12oz bottle into a snifter Bottled 18 January 2013 # 491 Burgundy wax The Barrel Room Collection Drank this one after the BT and before the Apple Brandy APPEARANCE: These all look the same basically. Thick black pour yields a 1+ finger, slightly looser, crackly, foamy dark tan head with decent retention. Inky black body with no real carbonation evident. Head crackles down to a decent foamy cap and then to a foamy ring only. Ring and a few wispy dots remain but no lacing down the sides. Black and nasty, but a decent-at-best head. SMELL: This is basically the same as the Buffalo trace version. Big nose with plenty of bourbon, oak, vanilla, coconut, molasses, toffee and pure dark chocolate.  Very aromatic and quite full of barrel aromas. Perhaps a touch of roasted grain in there, but the barrel, which is rather decadent in itself, plays the most important role here. Maybe a touch more oak than the BT version, but they’re basically identical. TASTE: Again, virtually the same as the Buffalo Trace version, with just a few small differences. Oak and bourbon up front, with vanilla, coconut and some dark chocolate at the swallow. Flavorful finish, with plenty of toffee and coconut, vanilla sweetness, bourbon, some roasted grains and nice, pure, bitter dark chocolate as well. Aftertaste is sweet, malty, more toffee than the BT variant, with plenty of barrel and oak character and lingers nicely on the palate. A bit more boozy and just a touch more toffee and oak on the finish, but the differences are almost non-existent. Good stuff. PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. A touch light perhaps and not quite as creamy as the BT variant. A bit prickly even. Goes down fine with no real bite, perhaps a light scratch at this point, and finishes sticky on the palate. Some decent heat lingers as well. Okay, but with all barrel aged beers, they often lack that heavyweight feel I so love in the style. A little more prickly than Buffalo Trace. OVERALL: This is wonderful, wonderful stuff. Lots of great barrel flavors and a nice big stout underneath it all. This variant is perhaps not as decadent as the Buffalo Trace version for the simple fact that it is a little more alcoholic and the feel is not quite as smooth, but those are minor issues. I would say the Trace is the best of the three but this is a very close second. In the end, however, they’re all great and I enjoyed every drop of these. Thanks again for thinking of me claaark13.

Black Magick - Pappy Van Winkle,"Reviewed by adamette from Ohio 4.53 /5 rDev -4.2% look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Pappy Van Winkle Black Magick Poured from the 12 ounce bottle that I bought on the first Barrel Room Collection release event on or about January 30th, 2013.  WRITTEN with a Sharpie on the custom, numbered label is “1-18-13” so this is nearly two years old.  It is bottle #230.  I waited for hours in the cold for this beer and all of the others that made up the Barrel Room Collection box.  That day I had one of the best beers of my life, a barrel aged BBVD (Big Black Voodoo Daddy) so, yes, I am psyched to try this one tonight. A   Maroon wax covers the capped bottle.  I hate to even destroy it to get to the bottle cap but a guys got to do what a guys got to do.  Finally worked my way carefully around and through the wax covering on the bottle and removed the tightly placed cap and there is a satisfying “pssst” as I open it.  Pours an oil black with a dark brown but thin head on top into a clean, clear glass.  Head dissipates into a thin single layer and then that even breaks up further so that there are islands of bubbles on top of the oil blackness.  Could not improve the look.  5.0 S   Dark Roast malt and Whiskey dominate.  There is “heat” in the smell as well.  This is going to be good.  4.5 T   Wow, a lot going on here.  The deep dark goodness of Black Magick with the Barrel Aged Whiskey notes.  The taste lingers maybe as long as any beer I can remember with a nice velvety thickness remaining on my togue well after my most recent sip.  The dark roast malt and whiskey certainly carry over from the smell right into the taste.  The whiskey may be a bit strong but this is a sipper of a beer.  Artisan beer from brewers of Artisan Styles.  4.5 M  Thick, velvety feel as mentioned in “taste” section.  Wow this beer has a HUGE mouthfeel!  4.5 D/O  Drinkability is only fair since it is so expensive AND it really is a sipping beer.  I could not imagine drinking two of these, let alone ANY OTHER beer tonight.  It has center stage.  It is the opening act and the main act.  Overall, again this is an Artisan beer from brewers of Artisan beer styles.  4.5 Notes:  This is the “first” of those Barrel Room Collection beers that I stood in line for and purchased from the brewery nearly 2 years ago that I have reviewed.  I am certainly looking forward to tasting and reporting on the remaining ones right here on BA! Jan 01, 2015 Report",4.53

Reviewed 12-14-23. Beer poured black with a very nice tan head with the initial pour-4.25. Nose is awesome as i am getting a medium roasted malt base that absorbs the rest in the bourbon barrels which lends notes of cocoa and bourbon.  The vanilla adjunct is very prevalent and lends a nice tangent-4.5. Taste is a medium roasted malt base that gives a big dose of vanilla up front with the barrels lingering in the background.  With subsequent sips the blast of vanilla is coalescing with the barrels and am getting cocoa presumably from the choice of malts used.  Finishes almost sweet but hopping and the barrels take that away-4.5. Mouthfeel is very good as the large malt base is very viscous and each sip delightfully smooth-4.5. Overall, initially graded Taste at 4.25 because it seemed to have too much vanilla but as my palate acclimated everything came together very nicely.  A big thanks to Tim for a very generous trade!

I’ve been wanting to try this one for quite some time, so let’s just get right into it Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of frothy dark brown head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing The nose is sweet but quite complex. I’m picking up on aromas of vanilla bean, burnt caramel, earthy bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, toasted oak, walnut, chocolate fudge, raisin, and light roast coffee It’s very similar in taste and I have absolutely no complaints about that. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, dark bread, caramel, medium roast coffee, sweet bourbon, charred oak, raisin, brown sugar, and light molasses. The swallow brings notes of toasted oak, molasses, vanilla bean, walnut, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, black cherry, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, and raisin A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a silky beer.

This is from the notes. Pours the color of strong coffee (""Stout Black"" I like to call it) and is light blocking dark in the glass with just a little walnut hue on the edges.  The deep brown head is inviting and slow to dissipate. The aroma gave me vanilla first, bourbon second, and the menagerie of dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, wood, char that make up the malts contribution to the smells.  Very nice, if a little more vanilla than expected. The taste was solid.  The vanilla, so heavily featured in the aroma, was first on the tongue, followed and overwhelmed my the coffee-chocolate-dark fruits almost cake like in effect; not sweet exactly, just decadent (if that makes any sense) The bourbon was in the swallow, terminating the pastry party effectively. The feel was a viscous pleasure.  For such an ABV I like something with heft, or body - to sip and savor, not quaff down like some AAL.  This nicely fits my preferences almost perfectly. Would love to try again, but glad I got to try it at least once. Jun 28, 2023 Report",4.68

L: Thick, jet black.  Utterly still.   There's a thin coat of rusty, coppered-coloured foam atop the glass. S: Umami roastiness, booze, vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, and ethereal spirit notes from the bourbon.  Surprisingly, this didn't change much as the beer warmed. T: Vanilla and bourbon notes dominate the initial swallow, and then a wave of booze crashes over the top, burning throat, tongue and larynx like a good RIS should.  There's a tangy hit of malt and then a retronasal whack of cookie dough settles in and lingers long.  Warmth settles in the stomach and a medicinal sweetness slides in after the cookie dough fades.  There's an excellent balance to this beer - there's no danger of cloying sweetness, nor is there so much stickiness that wasps begin to hover expectantly around my head. M: Mouthfeel is thick and unctuous - there's minimal carbonation but it suits the beer well.  As noted above there's warmth seeping lazily through my body at the halfway mark of this one, and it settles deep and comfortably, like an old, familiar couch. O: This is an enjoyable but intense beer experience. There's no likelihood of a second beer after you've spent an hour or so in the company of this beer, but the size of this beer means that's not a problem. Cheers! #242 May 26, 2023 Report",4.23

The beer is opaque and has good clarity. Aroma: The aroma is rich and complex with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, dark fruit (figs, raisins), and a hint of smokiness. There is also a distinct hop character that adds to the overall aroma profile. Taste: The flavor is full-bodied and robust with a rich, creamy mouthfeel. The dark chocolate and coffee notes are prominent, with hints of dark fruit, toasted nuts, and smokiness. The hop character adds a pleasant bitterness to the finish. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a moderate carbonation that adds a nice effervescence. The beer is full-bodied and has a long finish that lingers on the tongue. Overall impressions: Fundamental Observation is a well-crafted, complex beer with a rich flavor profile. The aroma and taste are well-balanced, and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.

This review is for the 2019 vintage.  The 2019 is not substantially different (going off memory), although I think the body (mouthfeel) is a little thicker. Surprisingly, at 3 years this beer hasn't lost much (any?) vanilla, although refrigerated most of that time. The best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell.  The nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing - with a hint of something else.  Perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract.  The taste is similar, but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for.  It's the essence, but not direct flavor.  Lots of deep, fudgy chocolate.  A bit of alcohol on the back end, which is unusual, but I suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla.  While tasty, I wouldn't say that the taste is complex. Nothing exceptional about this beer, but it is very good.  I think that my score accurately reflects how I feel about this beer and what I think it is deserving of. Sep 24, 2022 Report",4.23

Fundamental Observation,"Reviewed by Sparty1224 from Michigan 4.79 /5 rDev +2.4% look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75 Serving: 1 Pt. 0.9 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. This is the 2019 edition, so a little age on it. Sorry, it's all I could find! The bottle has 2 check boxes though, one for ""drink fresh"" and one for ""cellar and save"" and the latter is checked. So I'm at least following the rules. A: Pours super dark and thick, motor-oil like. Nice lacing up the glass. Minimal off-white head that fades quickly. S: Huge vanilla up front. It's like extract, maybe vanilla coffee creamer. Super on the nose, with a little bourbon note behind it. T: Again, vanilla is the centerpiece. It's a real sweet vanilla note here, I know it's not extract, but it's so concentrated and strong. Bourbon there on the finish, really a second player to the vanilla. M: This is where this beer really excels. Nice, full mouthfeel. Very balanced. The vanilla is huge, but so is the bourbon. Feels like everything is in HD. Way chewier and thick than some of the more recent BCBS beers I've had. O: Okay, well. This is very good. I'll start by saying I am not familiar with BL at all. I always noticed FO at the top of the 250 list, but it was so out of reach, I didn't think much of it. Was very fortunate to take a vacation to SF recently and a shop still had some '19 bottles left. Seems like the big comparison point with this beer is BCBVS, which I can totally see. I haven't had that beer in some time, so this isn't a 1:1. But I'll say just from memory that this beer is every bit as good, if not better. My initial impression is that I like the mouthfeel and balance of this beer more. But I do feel the vanilla flavor of BCBVS might be a tough better. This is really strong and vanilla forward, and it's a really sweet and pastry-like vanilla. Not that I want it subdued in any way, but BCBVS has it reeled in and maybe a little more natural-tasting. I really feel like I'm splitting hairs here. At the end of the day, it's huge props to BL for making a really good, chewy, balanced, BA stout. Oh, and I think the age may have even helped this beer. I get no sense of oxidation or fading of flavor. Again, the vanilla is huge on this. Recommendation: I think this beer deserves its ranking and reputation. Must try for any BA stout fan.

Fundamental Observation,"Reviewed by John_M from Washington 4.35 /5 rDev -7.1% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 The beers pours the expected blackish brown color with minimal lacing and fair at best head retention.  This beer has the look of a beer that has seen some pretty significant barrel aging (though it's not overly viscous).  On the nose I get dark chocolate and vanilla, with underlying bourbon and light licorice.  It's nice but I was expecting a more robust aroma profile.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet stout, but with a much greater level of intensity.  Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, moderately sweet finish.  Carbonation seemed to be on the low side, which I tend to think works well with rich, BA impy stouts (like this one).  Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell it's up there a bit.  Even so, there's no way I would guess an abv. in the 14% range. This is a very nice BA impy stout, no doubt, though I guess I was expecting a bit more complexity.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I'm not sure it's a beer I'd go out of my way to find.  Still a very solid beer... Apr 18, 2022 Report",4.35

I could sniff this all day; there’s dark rye bread, beef jerky, baker’s chocolate… That flavor, though. It tastes like a pastry - fig, vanilla, caramel, flaky shell - that doesn’t actually exist. But then it’s also cake! Steph sez: “It’s like they crashed a full bakery into the bottle.” 4-way mud wrestling match between all the vanilla (both bean + barrel, yet without any booze from the latter), sugar, dark fruit, and roasty notes. Everyone takes a turn without taking over. It’s a perfect example of barrel aging, it’s savoury, it’s dessert - walks a razor’s edge. How is it so cakey without being that sweet? How does it tame the sweet without being charred or boozy? Not hot, ashy, cloying, sugary… the execution is just baffling + masterful. All the hype is true. 2010 Vanilla BCBS is the only thing that comes close. Fantastic. Mar 04, 2022 Report",4.57

Fundamental Observation,"Reviewed by micada from New York 5 /5 rDev +6.8% look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5 2018 bottle Poured cold, hard to a tulip. Jet black, no floaters. No head at all…starts to bubble for a ring, then peters out. Nose is a sort of light smoked cherry wood, not at all what I expected. First sips are great! The mix of bourbon barrels is very complex. You don’t get any one distinct flavor, but rather a changing swirl of sweetnesses and woods. The vanilla comes in mid-palate with a sort of vanilla bean shell earthiness, a hint of coffee-ness without the coffee. The malts are deep, robust, providing a massive foundation. Some of that cherry comes back toward the finish. Mouthfeel  is perfect: Full but crisp and refreshing. Alcohol has that bourbon flavor, but no noticeable bite or warmth at this stage. As it warms, that might change. I can see why people search this out. Excellent brew! 2025 version review: this one is definitely a grittier, earthier vanilla vibe. The nose is all vanilla bean, opened up to reveal caviar. The bourbon is a bit tricky to find, though tannic quality abounds. The middle is solid dark malts with just beastly vanilla presence. The 14+% ABV hits hard. HARD. In some senses it’s a very focused / not complex brew with vanilla as the star, which artistic thought was a ding, but, over time it’s a defining theme. Madagascar vanilla stout? Yeah, you’ll want this one. Jul 30, 2021 Report",

The head has an amazing level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is heavy of a orange juice and tropical fruit aroma of tangerine, pineapple and a bit of mango.  Along with these aromas comes some strong herbal and floral smells as well as a bit of a grapefruit hop.  Other aromas of passionfruit and a bit of lemon and lime are in there as well.  With notes of apricot and peach, and a bit of bread rounding it all out a rather inviting aroma is produced overall. Taste – The taste starts out with a bready and chewy doughy flavor mixed with lots of fruit.  The fruit is heaviest of a tropical nature, with lots of tangerine, papaya, pineapple, and passionfruit, but the taste also has a decent showing of apricot and pear.  The hops are there from the start, with a decent showing of a herbal and earthy hop flavor paired with some grapefruit. The hop grows stronger as the taste advances, all while the sweet fades a tad.  Some more dankness comes to the tongue at the end of the taste transition, and with a bit of mustiness and a raw green hop taste, one is left with a rather malty and juicy, well hopped taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is very thick and chewy with a moderate level of carbonation. Great for the higher abv, malty nature, and mix of hop.  Rather well done on the feel. Overall – Another, slightly more malty, fresh hopped, and thicker, but balanced and very enjoyable brew.  Well worth a try if you have the opportunity. Jan 02, 2024 Report",4.42

Bottling date: 1/3/2014 best before: 1/3/2024 ABV: 7% Provenance: Stored at 3 Fonteinen's Beersel cellar (lambik-O-droom) until July 11, 2024. Fridge-stored at hotel and flown back to the U.S. on July 12, where it's been cellar stored at 50° until opening. Beautiful copper flecked golden coloration. A gentle pour from the cradle agitates minimal head; this one is quick to settle flat. The nose is fantastic. A bright introduction of lemon zest and floral honey play contrast to distinctly musty, mildly cheesy notes on the back end. There's an orchestrated balance, and the interplay between those touches of ammonia and oak with the zesty citrus and punches of honey sweetness make for a truly special aromatic intro. The palate is a masterclass in oak treatment and blending. While time has brought such delicacy to this inaugural batch, there's still a noticeable sharpness. An initial punch of lemon rind and oaky dryness opens the door for a previously dormant acidity to surge into the mid-palate. The finish leaves with it a soft puckering to accompany low bitterness and a whisper of ammoniated funk. A light-bodied geuze, with low but present carbonation. Medium acidity, with a bit of lingering pucker. The finish is tart, with  drying tannins helping to cut the lingering acid. With 30 minutes to decant, the nose becomes a bit more cohesive and a touch funkier, while the palate slightly decreases in its acidity while the oak is more noticeable on the front-end of the palate.

Too much at cellar temp, but when it got to room temp, it was more tasty, but still too much on the sour side for my taste. Feel - Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. Overall - Just too sour and acidly of a lambic for me to really enjoy; I need to give another blend another shot just to see if it was this batch, or if Zenne might not be my thing.

Zenne Y Frontera,"Reviewed by zac16125 from South Carolina 4.77 /5 rDev +1.5% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75 A: Pours crystal clear, dark golden yellow, almost amber, small fizzy white head that dissipates quickly.  4.25 S: Aroma is tart lactic acidity, a big minerality, some plastic like funk notes, only the faintest barnyard characters. Mild sherry notes give it a subtle fruitiness.   A bit of spice on the finish like white pepper.  4.75 T: Taste is immediately wildly complex. There’s a sweetness up front followed by a sour tart punch, then lingering oaky vanilla on the finish that lasts forever. It’s not as aggressively tart as some lambics/gueuzes, likely subdued by the cask asking.  Other characters I get are red grapes, tart citrus, moderate spice.  Just fantastic, so much going on, and the finish is divine. 5 M/D: Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Carbonation lower than most in the style but insanely drinkable.  4.25 O: A gem of a beer.  Well worth the hype.  An elite beer. 4.75 Sep 03, 2022 Report",4.77

Zenne Y Frontera,"Reviewed by Sabtos from Ohio 4.59 /5 rDev -2.3% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75 Having this (season 18|19 blend 92) side-by-side with regular Oude Geuze (season 18|19 blend 69), for maximum contrast, Zenne is a much darker amber, with a short khaki head that settles to a thin off-white ring. The nose is nougat and nutty dusty musty walnut to the nth degree. Taste exhibits sweet honey and caramel characteristics, and upon intermingling with the sherry barrels, this emulates a caramel apple and even mulled cider, all while maintaining starkly savory notes attributed to the barrel. This puppy is dry af, and also a bit more acidic than OG, yet simultaneously more complex, especially as it warms. Even still, it maintains in the background those classic toasted cracker and grapefruity 3F properties. As mentioned, the contrast between regular OG and this is astounding. While the Oude Geuze is simply more drinkable, effervescent, and lightly brightly clean, I can see how a brew like this stands out from the crowd and makes a very uniquely intriguing impression. At the same time, I can't imagine solo doming a whole bottle of this, it's just so complex. Sharing is the move here. --- In December of 2021, I shared a blend 93 from the same season 18|19, and found the experience to be a revelation. The foggy burnt gold to amber body builds a short but fuzzy off-white head that settles to a persistent ring. Both more toasty of that unique 3F seediness and also more tart, tangy and juicy of orange and apricot qualities than the last vintage I remember, this bottling is actually crazy refreshing and delicious, while not as funky, musty and woody as my prior experience. The medium body contains a fine fizz and comes to a semi-dry finish that's a little chewy and slightly stinging, where hints of raspberry even crop up. Nutty oak does slowly emerge with time, but this gueuze's overall translation is brighter and juicier than blend 92. I'm compelled to increase my original 4.29 score quite substantially based on this bottle, which was stored horizontally in my cellar and acquired in the same release as the above reviewed bottle, undisturbed since then. While time in the bottle may have been a factor in its development, (and, might I add, this is the only style I can wholeheartedly endorse intentionally aging in the first place), I feel I'm getting a more well-rounded sense of what Zenne is about as well. I have another blend to try at some other date, and now I just can't wait. I might give it yet another year, though. --- In June of 2023, we enjoyed a new blend 93, from season 21|22 this time, freshly released on site in Lot. It was very toasted seed and nut forward with an underlying touch of nougat and dusty dusty dusty oak. It actually manages to somehow exude a much older vibe than the 1998 vintage we had just before it, but with a lovely lovely froth and a little grapefruit acidity. It's just so intensely nutty!!! This, ultimately, is my overall impression of what Zenne boils down to. If it ain't nutty from that sherry, then it ain't Zenne. --- At the end of August 2025, we popped a blend 55 from season 23|24, which presented as pretty classic OG at first before suddenly becoming a more tart and juicy. The sherry comes in nutty and woody in the exhale, but not as heavy as it usually is. In its place, the juiciness gives tangerine with hints of white grape and cherry, making it overall brighter in every way, and less seedy or toasty than typical 3F. After some time, the nose does start to develop salted caramel, but remains only there. The finish is beautifully bone dry. A unique bottling, this one. Oct 13, 2020 Report",4.59

It was over a decade ago. I so rarely have imperial stouts, and it seems every time I have one it takes me a few minutes to get used to them again. It's amazing how similar this is to the basic BCBS, at least as my memory serves. There is definitely some rye character that adds a nice spicy nuance, but the bones of this stout are the same as the old 2014 vintage. Pitch black body, viscous as motor oil. No head or lacing, but the little bubbles that do arise create a little tan island that makes cool patterns when you swirl it. Aromas of vanilla, dark chocolate, fudge, molasses, caramel, nutmeg, pipe tobacco, cloves, raisins, dried figs, cherries, licorice, dark roast coffee, sourdough, and rye bread without caraway. Super vanilla forward on the palate. Honestly I think it's a little sweeter than I prefer, but the bitter dark chocolate comes in to balance it out. Long evolution here that goes from sweet vanilla caramel into molasses, then dark chocolate, then finishes as dark chocolate fudge with rye spice and clove. Definitely a dessert beer. Mouthfeel is very viscous. I'd even say it's a little syrupy, but I've had worse. Overall a very good example of the style. Don't think it deserves the #10 spot, but we all know these rankings are basically meaningless. Cheers! 87 B+ Jun 18, 2025 Report",4.35

Today, we're excited to warmly welcome the return of this iconic member of the Bourbon County Brand Stout family. Vanilla, as an ingredient, has made an appearance in Bourbon County lineups over the years, but the 2024 Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Rye Stout is a new take on our 2014 Vanilla Rye release. This year’s release showcases rye and the complexity it delivers by starting with a rye imperial stout and aging it in freshly emptied rye whiskey barrels. After aging in barrels for a full year, the stout is then finished with incredibly aromatic madagascar vanilla beans.

Carbonation is a little too lively, a couple of swirls in the glass tames it down.

Chocolate profile is standard for the base stout. Finish seems a little thinner than I remember for these stouts and it's still a bit hot, but I'm no longer holding these for a year because too often they lose some of the adjunct flavor depth, although this stout ages very nicely.

Bourbon country stouts have always been some of my favorites beers on the market. 2024 variant (best by 08/05/29), consumed across two days 03/11-12. Bought at Total Wine and More in San Diego. ~$25 for 16.9 oz bottle. A&S: Little bit of a lackluster look, but understandable with the aging. Licorice black colored beer. The pour appears pretty thick. The head is chocolate colored and pours a half finger of foamy fizz. Dies quickly and doesn't leave a trace. Little oily on the glass. Heavy vanilla in the nose off the bat and sweet. Other components are dark fruits (prunes), chocolate, and rye. Hints of caramel T&M: Upfront brownie batter and marshmellows. Midtaste dark cocoa and big vanilla vibes. Peppery rye and oak finish with hints of fudge. It has a wonderful balance between its sweet start and a more bitter and dry finish. Still bozy, but hides it 14% ABV slightly. Ludicrus mouthfeel. So thick and chewy yet just enough of a carbonation tingle. Overall: This beer didn't disappoint. I think its fine to drink now, or store it for another +6 months. The booze fit well with it, even with it being slightly hot. I would say for the price, I'd just stick with the original, but it's still fun to try something new. If you want to treat yourself to a slightly elevated version, this is a good bet.

Inky with dark cinnamon/cocoa colored head, the drinking experience is phenomenal as the blending of flavors is perfect.  Vanilla intertwines with dark and milk chocolate, hints of coffee, nuanced hits of spicy rye whiskey, touches of wood, and leather.  No one flavor tries to top another.

This solid little imperial pours a pitch black with a moderate head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring, thin swirling layer, and sports some light lacing and nice legs.  Nose of vanilla, dark chocolate, cream, dark roasted malts, and light oak.  Flavors surpass the nose with subtle spicy rye, oak, rich vanilla, moderate char, deep roast, dark cocoa, dark coffee, and faint whiskey dashed with dark fruits and light cream. Mouth feel is full, smooth, rich, moderately slick, coating, lightly warming, and finishing with a bitter malt note. Overall, it's good but many of the other variants I have tried of this series shine above it. Cheers Jan 26, 2025 Report",4.35

Very quick-rising espresso head that is equally quick to fade, revealing a placid surface devoid of any retention. A faint ring of bubbling lacing coalesces around the edge of the snifter. Held to the light, opaque and near-black dark brown. S: Strong scent of vanilla, rye barrel, and whiskey. Dark chocolate, some roasted malt, and a hint of oak and char.

Pours jet black. Clear but completely dark. No light passes through it. Some dark brown foam peeks through on top. Aroma is like a more boozy, whiskey-forward version of the original. Compared to what I remember from my bottle of OG from 2024, this version is more assertive and fuller bodied, with less sweetness, but still retaining the signature BCBS brownie batter/dark cocoa aroma. Flavor is completely different. That same brownie/fudge characteristic is amplified, and my first sip was a blast of mellow vanilla. No roasty burnt notes at all. There's the presence of some spicy rye and cherry flavors, as well as a crazy alcohol burn, but no ethanol or even coffee flavors. This thing is pure, delicious milk chocolate and deep vanilla, balanced out by a little bit of rye. Finish is long, extending the chocolate and vanilla ideas, as well as presenting a tiny bit of the bourbon and tobacco notes from the original beer. Mouthfeel is exceptional, heavy and chewy. It's not the most sticky thing I've drank, but it's quite drinkable for all the sweet, thick flavors present, and the general lack of bitterness. This is not the most expensive bottle I've bought (that honor goes to 2023 BCBS Angels' Envy Reserve) but wow, does it match the price. It's a decadent chocolate and vanilla bomb with a complex finish and a lovely hit of spicy rye that balances out the sweetness ever so slightly. I think this is the smoothest thing I've ever drank. It is dessert, it is happy to be dessert, and does not want to be anything more than that. Beautiful stout and worth the price, since I got it much cheaper and easier than any other hyped up stout I've seen. Compared to 2024 Parabola, BCBS VR is smoother, sweeter, and easier to drink. Parabola was heavy on the tobacco and whiskey, but VR is the opposite. I'm at almost 2000 characters, but as a GI fanboy, this one hits hard. Jan 18, 2025 Report",4.72

Not much rye character on the nose, but there is definitely some rich chocolate within the bourbon/spirit character on both the nose and palate, with just the slightest hint and kiss of spice at the back of the flavor profile.

Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like vanilla, along with some roasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate and some oak.  Doesn't smell like whiskey at all.  The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some rye, bourbon, burnt/charred malt and some licorice flavors noticeable too.  As with the aroma, I think the vanilla stands out in the taste.  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation.  I liked this stout a lot, but I was hoping for more rye and bourbon here.  The vanilla overpowers the other flavors so I recommend this more to people who really like vanilla.  With that being said it's still tasty and worth trying if you get the chance!

The pour is a muddied brown-red with the expected lack of bubbles. The nose is a sharp spike of bourbon & booze. A Deal with the Devil – Triple Oaked is a multi-layered beast. The booze is off the charts for a malt-based product & the bourbon exhale is spectacular; if I drank the stuff I suspect I could pull some of the various bottles out of the layers. Underneath that glorious noise is black, bruised, sweet fruit just on the edge of gone, molasses, achingly sweet, before the desiccated oak brings it home. Shame this bottle is so small. I have lots of sick/vacation time to use on three of these in a night. Well, damn. Anchorage rarely misses on their big bottles & they better not based on the price point. This is transcendent.

Intensely woody up front, it even leans a little pungent and catty right out of the bottle. However, it quickly transforms into an explodingly delectable maple tempered by a whiskey heat that both continue to expand on the exhale and with each subsequent sip. Though this definitely shows its age, it's quite the experience nevertheless.

I've saved a truly legendary beer for this milestone review, the highest rated American Barleywine on BA and 13th highest rated overall. I just had the Double Oak version yesterday and it was damn good, so I have high hopes for this. Let's crack this beast open and see what it's all about Pours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a nothing and leaves no lacing, but with fantastic legs In the nose, it's also quite similar to Double Oak, though with some more barrel presence. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy bourbon, charred oak, molasses, burnt caramel, plum, black cherry, cognac, toasted coconut, sweet vanilla, old leather, light fig, and toffee The booze is more forward here, but it pushes such wonderful complexities in taste that it actually adds to the experience.  On the front end of the sip I'm tasting cocoa powder, black cherry, cognac, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, honey, molasses, dark toast, fig, sweet vanilla, raisin, light toffee, and tobacco. The swallow brings notes of leather, smoky tobacco, charred oak, molasses, fig, black cherry, toasted coconut, port wine, plum, cacao nib, burnt caramel, brown sugar, and light walnut A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a rich and silky beer. Finishes a tad sticky, but the boozy tingle  dries it out over time This is incredible. The Double Oak version was great too, but this one edges it out.

Similarly, a visibility on fingers thru a firewater viscosity, at a state where the collar is annulled, if tolerant on time. The pour is deep on mahogany, and transcendent on ruby highlights, while the neck transcribes a copper to chestnut tone. Correspondingly, a thinning out on retention to the hour, which terminates lace delicately, before that annulled header addressed above S: The cask recitals circumference the subtle (earthy) hop effects, which quarter the esters, while building a strong dexterity around sweet – bready – malt. An inclination on dark fruit that ranges to elderberries, when exhibiting dated prunes amongst raisins. Sequentially, an armored disposition on Crème caramel that’s been slightly browned to aptness, before taxing in a Mackintosh bar. The inclining humidity brawns a treacliness over a Black Forest Chocotorta & liquored truffles, while pitting leathery advances against brown sugar tobacco. Synchronously, a hop bite to softly cuddle malts candied advances on creamed variations, when sylvan elements develop upon the tarry dried fruit inclinations. With this in mind, a bittering – woodsy – expansion that’s deepening on pine resin around timberlands, yet a facilitating aid to not overextend the greenery virulence. Moreover, a step that nears Goobers with a charred following on walnuts, besides stale cherry bitters to coriaceous stipulations. Oxidation is lightly pressed against the late solvent esters that work to benefit the movement, by suggesting a Pedro Ximénez cleverness, while barreling the oak staves at length T: Bourbon continually pillars the complexity with a warming – humid – torridness on malt, as hops lightly frame a woodsy path. The elements touch on a caramelized fig custard, while parading crystallized stone fruit in a molasses – marshmallow – soufflé. Secondly, a posturing sweetness to neighbor an unwanted cloyingness in balminess; however, a position that’s impeccably groomed to cloak heat. In sequence, a spice to fruit component that prompts Ethyl Caproate under the residual malt pleasantness. There is an ongoing sentience over the varying cask proportions, which are competently equipped to gamble on the sustained aeriation. Thusly, meandering polymers to further provoke/strengthen vanillin aside honeyed spices, while continuing to calibrate the oak lactones. The barrel presence continues on to address almonds with lightly shredded coconut, as a hard Skor emanates against fudge. In addition, liquored raisins applied to charring, when shriveled cherries pass cordials & cola taffy, once hops attune that backwoods kick to face grape – brandy – bugs. A measure that becomes thirsting of tannin stipulations in the patient exertions, as dried leaves spread from a nearby – progressive – ruin M: Sidesteps under-attenuation in the inclusive duty, of not overwhelming the rich records. Nonetheless, the approach is sweet with a chewy dexterity and a warming sensation, while carbonation is handled in a judicious manner. An approach that does not burn or madden the slick feel, as longevity offers a calm smoothness, in the act of intellectualizing a system over the dry (oak) tannin mannerisms O: A hop bill that’s cautiously tempered against a glucose powerhouse, which bypasses the aggressiveness on bite, while still prominent to ally the esters. They offer a balance to the finer points on wood amid the several transfers, as malt sweetens the complexity chronologically, in anticipation of the craftily dry hooks. An onset that’s censoring on depth with a tough buildout; albeit, an advantageous/more beneficial buildout, if given the patience to draw out time Jun 29, 2022 Report",4.25

The barrel definitely helps the tooth curdling sweetness in the non-BA version.  I think it's great on the nose, but even as a BA stout, this is still a little too sweet for me.  I think 5 years ago I'd have thought I went to heaven and died having this.  In 2024, my palate just likes less of these adjuncts, or a much smaller pour.  Great dessert stout, no question, but I think my palate just likes this type of beer less than it used to. May 28, 2024 Report",4.42

The barrel isn't complex but it smooths out the balance here, allowing the coconut, vanilla and chocolate to shine without any getting too strong.

Sourness is under control and not too aggressive with more apricots and more funk with some pale malty flavors coming through as well.  On the finish there's some lemony tartness, more apricot, some lingering funk and a touch of chalky yeast. M:  This beer has a body which is on the lighter side of medium.  Carbonation is lightly effervescent while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity. O:  Overall this beer is outstanding.  Great flavors and complexity.

A beautifully crafted lambic which avoids the pitfalls of many other examples of the style (too sweet or too woody).  The fruit is used to soften the lambic base.  Excellent!

I’m finally having this beer, and my lucky review #777. This beer is the result of my first beer trade ever, thanks to the incredible fo5s. Much appreciated bro, I’ve had this marked as a want on here for just about 3 years. This is the #1 fruit Lambic, and has been for quite some time. It currently sits at #17 overall, and I can’t think of a better beer for my personal #777 as a very highly regarded apricot Lambic. I actually have a few trades going for different vintages of this, with updated reviews to come. Alright, I know that was a lot of numbers, let’s just get into it now Pours an opaque pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing This smells absolutely heavenly. Even with over a year of age on it the fruit hasn't faded like some say that it has. I'm assuming it's more prominent in a fresher batch, but it's wonderful here too. I'm picking up on aromas of jammy dried apricot, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, aged leather, white grape, earthy wheat, doughy malt, light pepper, and lemon rind This is unreal in taste as well, and not nearly as sharply sour as the aroma would suggest. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting juicy apricot, underripe peach, wheat bread, straw, pear juice, lemon rind, and light oak. The swallow brings notes of jammy dried apricot, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, peach rings, lemon rind, crackery malt, lime juice, and old leather A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp and tart beer. Finishes mostly dry but leaves a slight film behind on the tongue from the residual sugars I honestly think this might be the one of the best beers I've ever had. Everything is so nuanced but flavorful at the same time. The 6% abv keeps it beyond drinkable, almost crushable, but that is not what I wanna do with this beer. I'm gonna cherish every last drop of this one. With the others I get, I'll see how it develops over time. Another massive shoutout to fo5s for this one. Cheers BA! Sep 13, 2021 Report",

Delicious hop forward aroma, mostly minty with light touches of herbal like sweet tea.

Very enjoyable and unique nose. Oh is this palate gangbusters.  Silky and perfect creamy texture, mixing with just the right amount of malt sweetness and depth to stay away from sugar and syrupy overtones.  Juiced light pineapple and mint, with sweet flavors that go from vanilla to just about every tropical fruit flavor imaginable.  Creamed mint and ice cream on the finish, and yes..

The transfer(s) occur across natural nucleated sites, which avoids the unwanted lipids/impurities on the cross-reactions, for solidifications. Accordingly, a collar formation to the inch, as latticework – marginally – pushes through a rushed retreat. The brim comes in towards the .25in, which clings to the periods that reach 1cm, while the hours further the detachments per the foam-negative materials. With this in mind, the palette to the neck has a dark beige peak, as the rushed retreat has a mars brown rim. In turn, a viscosity factor that plays to the annulling properties aforesaid, which support the nuanced droplets that attune the advanced (teary) arches S: Malts frame the dexterities above a soft hop bill, while the oak casks work to build a complicated mass around the aged aldehydes. An ignition that politely connotes La Bête Noire with a Cajeta glaze, as figgy duff pairs alongside prunes + flame raisins. There is an oak stave to plank presence in exercise, which adds a dynamic balance to the sweet midsections. Supplementary to this, a calm hop effect that reinforces the barrel toned landscapes, when symbolizing forested alder to shagbark hickory. All the while, a ventilated deduction on the vintage, beyond the bettering cask aspects. This comes at a trained interval, which nears ≥68°F, for softening & blooming the – hourly – abstractions. Correspondingly, an enlightened (smart) complication that comes without additives, where the stability is maintained & rooted through coordination. The progression optimizes the breathing periods, by characterizing Palo Cortado through rawhide over clay pipes, outside the dried fruit subtexts over Atomic Fireballs. Moreover, a structure that continuously engages in complex polymers, when denoting lignins across tannins, in the act of rolling dry constitutions T: Soft barrel entitlements to the conversions set by diastatic enzymes, where hemicelluloses contribute to the cultured caramelization(s). Namely, maltol developments to the plot, for signifying doughy accounts on Nussbrezels under a Crème brûlée guise, as bourbon coats Chelan cherries + Moyer plums. The notations have a light implication on the makings that analog MalvaBons, while lightly addressing the oak lactones thru coconut. The age offers a refined sense on the phenolic aldehydes, as they lend vanilla by vanillin, which comes with a molasses – charred – nature. Howbeit, cautious to not exceedingly burn amid the oxidized transfers, across the carafe, where Fahrenheit gets incrementally pushed. There is a leathery standing behind the hydrolysable workings, which offer a steadying composure to the sweet malt passages. This is furthered by a low toned bitterness, when detailing the dark rosin inflections. Sequentially, a blooming allowance that recapitulates the sensed perceptions on sherry, where an oxidized nuttiness supplants English toffee. The sequences have dry – tannin derived – cessations, while carefully regulating spiced eugenols & smoked guaiacols, against the softly spoken (developed) acetaldehydes M: An intensity behind C₂H₆O that’s courteous to not suffocate, when attenuating sweetness. Thus, a treacly to thick mitigation with an alleviating bite, while the smooth ebullitions amalgamate over the tempered – carbonated – tiers. A feel that’s accompanied by age, besides the aeriated drafts, for paving a weathered maturity O: The degradations on hemicelluloses are rich in their pursuit on furfurals above ethyl acetates, which is fittingly appropriate, for perceiving malt. Oak compounds are continuous in the upsurge, of clocked intervals, as they are paired alongside the relaxed wooded hops. Correspondingly, a construction that offers more harmony, when providing the time with an uncapped patience Mar 31, 2023 Report",4.46

Was very excited to see this beer on tap, even at the price point ($14.99 for a 4 ounce pour). The beer poured the expected blackish brown color, with minimal lacing and not much in the way of head retention.  Still, I didn't think this was particularly unusual for a ba impy stout.  On the nose, I'm picking up dark chocolate, light licorice, some vanilla and a hint of cherry.  Not really getting much of any bourbon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this moderately sweet stout, but with a slight roasty component as well. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is pretty long.  As others have noted, there's some sort of odd flavor in the finish.  It's not bad, just unusual (a slight wet cardboard flavor).  Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, which I appreciate. This is a nice beer no doubt, but the accolades this beer garners is a bit of a head scratcher.  Likewise, the price tag for this beer is a puzzler as well.  I ordered 3 ba impy stouts at Ansari's, and the Assassin was clearly low man on the totem pole (a ba coconut stout from 608 brewing from Wisconsin was vastly superior to the Assassin).  Whatever.  Each to their own.  This is still a pretty good impy stout, but given the ""value quotient"" for this beer, I'm pretty sure this isn't something I'll ever need to order again.

Initially, big citrus aroma upon popping the can open. Before long there were also tropical fruit and melon aromas. Citrusy, fruity and melon-y hop flavor, with the melon-like aspect slightly higher in the mix than the other aspects, but it's quite well balanced. Bitterness is fairly light, but that lack of assertive bitterness doesn't make the beer overly sweet or cloying as a consequence. Hides it's abv quite well, and is rather easy drinking.

Finishes with a dry, medium bitterness and some grapefruit, guava and pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. As I have been chasing this beer all my life, perhaps it should come as no surprise to myself that I was slightly disappointed by it, as I have been by pretty much every other legendary beer that I managed to get my hands on. I always thought of this as the very quintessential West Coast IPA and I've had plenty of better ones, to be honest. It's just not quite bitter and resinous enough for me, while also having those slightly floral undertones that I personally dislike in a WCIPA. That's not to say that it's bad at all, quite the opposite, I enjoyed it well enough. I just think it's vastly overrated, as is often the case with these ""legendary"" beers. For the record, I've had this at just over 6 weeks old and if it doesn't hold up that long I consider this a brewing flaw, as I had plenty of better WCIPAs that were 2-3 months old.

Enormous, dense off-white head that falls to a hefty cap with super-tenacious cling to the glass. The smell isn't super strong and it's pretty straightforward. A little pine resin, slightly sweet malts, orange peel, grapefruit. Lightly floral, a touch of honey, and a bit of peppery spice. This is really setting the table - very much a ""drink me"" aroma. Right off the bat, the taste is superbly balanced. I get a little sweet taste up front along with orange peel and tangerine. There's floral hops and a surprising honey flavor. Clean, crackery malt provides a perfect base. There's a bit of pine resin, fairly strong grapefruit supplements the orange and tangerine. Kind of a white pepper spiciness and the floral notes come out in the aromatics after a swallow. The bitterness is not overly assertive - just enough to give a taste bud reset. The feel is medium-bodied, the carbonation is medium but it is not prickly - gentle I guess is the word. Sharp, crisp, clean, dry. Supremely drinkable, incredibly balanced. Absolutely hype-worthy.

This blend fits the tastebuds like a jacket. V.S.O.J. gets going with a dark and tawny garnet pour, caught somewhere between amber barleywine and black stout. As a dainty froth emerges, so does a deeply caramelized scent of toffee, maple, coconut, vanilla and a toasted nuttiness all wrapped in a boozy twinge of spice. With savory notes of port wine and sherry kiss the nose, the taste leans in with a savory sip of those caramelized malts with more nuances of coffee and cocoa finishing with a peppery peanut brittle character. Balanced with light bitterness, oak tannin and peppery alcohol, the session concludes sweet and spicy. Full bodied, weighted and sweet, the ale is more cloying than usual, making it fantastic for sips but also making drinkability limited. Aug 08, 2025 Report",4.29

Pours a deep, mysterious cola brown in color. Mocha colored head pops up with a loosely packed fluff that rises north of 2 inches before settling in at a diminutive ring that leaves the thinnest lace line, like a fine point marker.  Low retention-fine for style. Nose is glorious. A warm, gentle embrace of Bourbon comes in and graciously introduces the toffee, fig, and caramel. But there is so much more going on. Delicate, fruity barrel notes akin to brandy and smooth coffee. After warming a bit, a warm, not quite boozy, note that wafts between rye and an herbal, almost peppery, spice. This is luxuriously decadent. Yes, a bit sweet but still complex. A warmly Bourbon-kissed delivery of toffee, caramel, and dates starts things off. But she is profoundly alluring. Mild char, coffee, and again some fruity notes that are deep and ""barrely."" A melange of Bourbon and brandy notes but in a very ""wet staves"" way. Mouthfeel is just a tad heavier than many barleywine but amazing. The finish tamps back the sweet just a tad and makes room for a hint of wood on the end. Politely warm in its presentation of ABV. Overall, so grateful to finally try this classic. Mar 15, 2025 Report",4.46

The nose of this is defined by caramel candy which has fallen into a barrel of fine Bourbon, as well as burned grains and notes of milk chocolate to smooth out the heat, arising from the spirit. Its mouthfeel feels medium bodied with a lively late carbonation among a very well balanced impression. Tastes of milk chocolate covered toffee, together with utmost spicy licorice and balancing burned malts, inheriting a dryness which gets echoed by the prominent oak barrel, revealing notes of lavender, black pepper and creme brulee with a bit of heat to it. Its mid palate appears way calmer with the chocolate settling in more, revealing caramel and honey among cocoa and flamed wood. Finishes with an uprise of warming Bourbon accompanied spices, lasting chocolate and a licorice peak, slowly transforming into a warming, oak forward aftertaste. A very solid and well balanced beer with a nice dry undertone to justify its overall sweetness. Jan 10, 2025 Report",3.99

Canned on 7/9/24, making this basically 4 months old at this point. A: Pours a very muddy, dark brown color with a slight red hue. Kind of a nasty look, but usually typical of these BA barleywines. S: This is where the beer shines. Huge molasses, fig, butterscotch, vanilla, and bourbon. Very inviting. T: Very sweet! Wow. After that sugar punch, you get the vanilla, oak, some fig and plum notes. Little bit of gingerbread. Slight bourbon on the finish, but not boozy at all. M: Nice and full, super decadent. Shockingly drinkable for the high ABV, but I imagine that has to do with the immense sweetness this beer has. Almost cloying! O: Wow! Have not had a Top 25 beer in a while. Super lucky to grab this while in Chicago over the summer. Never was a huge Revolution fan, but I do know they're famous for their BA barleywines, and this is one of them. Right off the bat, I was super impressed. Instant flashback of BCBBW, and it's probably the best BA barleywine I've had since the BCBS 2-year. My only gripe (and I see this a lot elsewhere) is the sweetness. I think it's a touch (or a ton) too sweet, and even at 14% could use a small ABV bump to help it out. Also was bummed to see it was a cuveé and I wonder if that has something to do with it. Either way, great beer. One of the best in the style. Recommendation: Maybe #25 is a bit inflated for a beer with this many flaws (overly sweet), but it's still a standout for the style and a great beer for those longing for old-school BCBBW.

A long time want of mine, I wanted to try it while I have the Double Barrel VSOJ on the way thanks to Tavour. I’ve had the OG Straight Jacket and some variants before, but this is by far the most exciting. Let’s get into it Pours an opaque dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing The nose brings an intense wave of sweetness, but it’s balanced out by spicier notes. I’m picking up on aromas of burnt caramel, sweet whiskey, molasses, rye bread, golden raisin, brown sugar, charred oak, old leather, fig, tobacco, and sweet toffee Wow, everything in taste is kicked up a notch, boozy and fruity but not overly sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting fig, sweet toffee, burnt caramel, black cherry, molasses, dry oak, vanilla, earthy whiskey, and light brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of sweet whiskey, charred oak, molasses, rye bread, tobacco, raisin, brown sugar, burnt caramel, vanilla, old leather, and light toffee A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes a tad sticky and boozy, yet still drinks well below the listed 15% Oh yeah, this is one hell of a beer.

And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance.  I am literally drooling. The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that  provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate.  Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV). The mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily, as expected.  I sat on this a bit, and it was more than worth the wait.  Truly a world class English barleywine. Sep 04, 2022 Report",4.71

If not held against a light, or if poured in a dark room, the beer looks black. Moderately heavy oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl, foreshadowing a heavy, hearty beer. Head is two and a half fingers of khaki foam. Aroma is raisins, fig, toffee, molasses, and dark fruits mashed together with leathery, spicy bourbon. Barrel adds additional char and heat, which is smoothed out well by hearty caramel, toasty, and bready malts. That dark fruit character really starts to swell up and become a much more major player in the aroma as the beer warms. Flavor profile is fig, raisins, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, and hearty dark fruits. Grassy hops add some resinous hop presence, which introduces some pleasant variation to the profile that is not a sugary note, heavy malt, or bourbon. Bourbon is present throughout, but becomes much more present on the back half of the flavor profile, building up heat and complexity akin to the way a snowball builds rolling down a hill. Despite that build up, it never runs away with heat. Underneath it all is strong caramel, bready, and toasty malts. Mouth feel is thick with a still effervescence, offering up some light bubbles at the start before smoothing out at the mid-way point. A very light silt adds some further texture, but really, it's smooth. The texture matches, both, the aging process output, and alcohol, suggesting this beer has been slowly pressed flat by the act of time and heavy alcohol. Overall, a remarkable beer that pairs bourbon barrel complexity over a resounding barleywine. Regardless of notes, it's a remarkable beer for sipping, offering complexity and depth at every corner and crevice. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can. Canned June 29, 2021. 15% ABV. For kicks, this was served side-by-side with Piggyback 6yr Rye aged in V.S.O.J. barrels. This is a sample from barrel #1. A few notes: Dark coloration, with moderate oily legs after a swirl. Spicy rye on the cusp of the nose, with heavy barrel leading way to floral and mild bourbon and dark fruits behind. Complexity is dense, mixing in a little cake at the finish. Flavor profile brings a more mild profile, building spicy rye over oak, lemon zest, floral and mild dark fruits and bourbon. Spice simmers on the back of the palate long after a sip, emphasizing the rye base. Really smooth, with a crescendo from start to finish that resembles a wheelchair ramp - a linear rise from start to finish. Served neat in a Glencairn glass. Apr 23, 2022 Report",

V.S.O.J.,"Reviewed by JohnnyHopps from Indiana 5 /5 rDev +6.8% look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5 Appearance - The beer poured a golden copper color with a small collection of bubbles topping the poor. Smell - The nose was sweet. Notes of caramel and earthy malts came before the booze. Taste - Oh my! Caramel lead the way, followed by leather and mild bourbon. The booze was so perfectly balanced that it took nothing away from the base beer. This is an example of a beer that slept well in barrels. The profile was modestly warming but certainly did not burn. Mouthfeel - The body was thick but not cloying. It lingered just long enough to have me wanting more. Overall - This was a fantastic beer. Dec 11, 2021 Report",

Served in a snifter. The beer is completely black with a big dark tan/khaki head that slowly recedes leaving behind bits of lacing. The aroma is chocolate, caramel, coffee, and bourbon. There are also notes of maple syrup and vanilla, though not nearly as strong on the maple as I was expecting. The flavor is roasted malts, caramel, coffee, cocoa, and to a lesser degree maple and vanilla. The bourbon is noticeable, but not overdone.  Full bodied and well carbonated, very easy to drink and very smooth. Overall, this is a terrific beer. I was a bit apprehensive at first as I am not a huge fan of maple syrup, and so many breweries that make a maple stout are far too heavy handed with it, but Founders seems to show just enough restraint to make this a very good beer without hitting you over the head with it!

Pours near black with a robust 2"" head that settles to a solid cocoa cap, thin streaks of lacing. Nose is coffee grounds, cocoa, baking chocolate, roasted barley and malt; very light barrel and maple at this point. As it warms, a little more maple character, along with some light soy. Taste remains well balanced even after 6+ years - maple sweetness, malt/roast, tannic barrel; cola-like citrus sweetness. Remarkable how well this has held up. Feel is light for the ABV and compared to other adjunct stouts. Having had so many imitators, was expecting the original to pale in comparison; instead, it not only held up, but surpassed the competition. Mar 21, 2024 Report",4.49

Aromas are spot on. Chocolate, coffee, yet with a complexity you can't describe. Backs it up on the flavor with the addition of some maple, honey, and bourbon sweetness. Still complex with a balanced finish. Not sure why they held this one back and why it's not easy to find, but this could easily be an annual release.

Pours very dark brown, verging on black, and nearly opaque.  More head than anticipated at this age.  Dark tan head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Thin but persistent lacing and legs. Initially strong aromas of chocolate and coffee, but as the brew warms, maple, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, leather, and tobacco all gradually manifest.   Additional warming yields anise. Five years of aging have rounded off all of the edges of this brew in a very good way.  Chocolate, coffee, maple syrup, bourbon, vanilla, white pepper, oak, cherries, and anise are all separately discerned, but smoothly melded.  One of the smoothest barrel aged brews I've ever had. Nearly-chewy big-beer body, but not sticky in any way.  The ABV is only noticed as warmth and a tingle on the tip of the tongue.

Served and consumed starting at 45 F and warming to close to room temperature. Look: Deep, dark brown, almost (but not quite) black.  Thin chocolate colored head, but more than I expected for a four year old bottle. Smell: Maple and chocolate and immediately obvious, with noticeable bourbon as well.  Little to no coffee. Taste: The strong maple sweetness and the bourbon are noticeable first.  Some chocolate is there, but very little coffee except for some bitterness in the aftertaste.  The lack of an overwhelming coffee taste works well here, as it lets the maple and bourbon shine but provides just enough bitterness to offset the maple sweetness. Feel: Silky and smooth with a moderate bite on the back end.  The 11.3% ABV is more noticeable in the feel that the taste.  Warmth and a mild sting from the alcohol are both present, but not in overwhelming amounts. Overall: this is a world-class beer for good reasons.  This is my very last bottle, so unless Founders re-releases it in the future I'll just say CBS will forever be one of the absolute best barrel aged stouts I have ever had the pleasure of sampling.

A good amount of malt to tie things together. F - full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and soft - though not as soft or full bodied as Haze O - an incredibly well rounded NEIPA. Having this the night after Haze, I'd say Julius is lighter in body to Haze while having a more citrus forward flavor profile compared to Haze's pillowy soft full body with more peach notes.

THE head has a great level of retention, fading very slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass. Smell -The aroma is big of a musty grainy and bready smell mixed with lots of raw hop aromas of a herbal and earthy nature.  There are other citrus aromas of orange and tangerine as well as hints of grapefruit mixed within.  Notes of apricot and some grass are in there as well, giving a rather raw and sorta green smell to the brew overall. Taste – The taste starts out drier than one would anticipate from the nose.  It begins with a mix of bready and cracker malt flavors combined with hop flavors of a very potent herbal and grapefruit hop.  Notes of a floral and pine hop flavor are there as well, but these tastes are light in comparison to the herbal hop.  All the hop flavors are rather “raw” in nature, having an almost hop pellet like flavor associated with them.  These potent flavors are the dominant ones throughout much of the taste.  While said, there is a decent showing of fruit flavors of tangerine, peach, and apricot, as well as a hint of mango.  The mix of sweet, bready and hop take the taste to its end, where it leaves one with a rather green hopped and slightly fruity and malty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body is a bit more on the creamy and chewy side with a carbonation level that is on the more moderate side. For the rich hop and malt flavors the feel is well done and makes for a nice easy sipper. Overall – A very nice brew overall.  I think I like this better than the King Julius as it is more approachable from my standpoint, but hits all the same high notes as the king variety.  Big and flavor and drinkability with a nice blend of hop, malt, and fruit. Sep 16, 2023 Report",4.44

Pours a dark brown, pushing to black with plum like highlights at the edge of glass - a minimal short lived light brown head. Aroma is a blast of bourbon soaked raisins, brown sugar, dates, oaked vanilla, and toffee - boozy raisin bread pudding, hint of chocolate, and hard to deny the evident alcohol. Up front is boozy and sweet on the palate - vanilla, brown sugar, bourbon infused raisins and dates. The toasted edges of sticky toffee pudding with an oaky bourbon glaze continue the sweet warming boozy flavour. Smooth and rich full mouthfeel - again warming booziness with soft carbonation - lovely alcoholic sweetness with rich flavours lingering.

This beer is 2299. I am using a tulip glass and serving the beer at 50 degrees. The pour created a frothy, airy, one fingered tan light tan head, with poor retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The color is dark brown with Mahogany hues, charting at SRM 30, and mostly opaque. The appearance of the beer is average, I would like to have a longer lasting head. Nosing the glass, I smell caramel, vanilla, bourbon (lots of bourbon), oak, char, toffee, alcohol, figs, date, light floral, orange peel, dried stone fruits, and plums. Smelling the beer, I am admiring how the beer has all this different aromas, yet nothing is overpowering.  I also smell chocolate, light roasted coffee, tobacco, earthiness, toasted sugar canes, toasted bread crust, malty sweetness, and light smokiness. Sipping the glass, I take a moment to savor the deliciousness of this Barleywine. The flavors start with the bourbon and the barrel aging, I was not sure if the double barrel aging would add too much oak flavors, but it somehow is finessed into the Barleywine with care. Flavors of bourbon, light smoke, orange peel, caramel, toasted wood, and vanilla started dancing on my palate. Then the massive malt complex with toasted cereal grains, roasted malts, malty sweetness, toffee, mild chocolate, toasted bread crust, and light coffee mingle in harmony with barrel aging. As flavor deepens on the palate I notice floral, toasted sugar cane, floral, molasses, toffee, dried cherries, plums, dates, raisins and figs brings a lively sweetness toning down the alcohol. The mouthfeel is chewy and coating, finishing warm. The body is heavy and has low carbonation. I was unsure if putting down a mortgage payment for this beer would be worth. Yes the beer is fantastic and maybe it should be a once in a lifetime event for any beer lover. As I savor the last drops of this beer, I am reminded I have another bottle for another day.

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"Reviewed by Harrison8 from Missouri 4.61 /5 rDev -1.7% look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 2020 version (black wax on can), enjoyed over a series of ~3-4oz pours throughout the day. Look: First pour results in a muddy brown pour with hints of burgundy. No head formation, with the top of the beer covered by a dense layer of oil. Additional pours don't return the muddy look, though transparency is still heavily obscured. Aroma: Powerful & boozy. It offers up deep chocolate, toffee, and dark fruits. Oak and char draw some focus away from the underlying heavy barleywine notes, though barleywine notes shine through the heat a bit more as the beer warms. After the beer has warmed from fridge temp to ~50f (guesstimate), it smells like booze soaked dark fruits, molasses, and oak, with the potent alcohol much more reserved. Flavor profile: Booze soaked toffee, fig, dark fruits, and cherry. The cherry note is really odd and disrupts the flow, thankfully this note fades away as the beer warms. As that cherry note fades away, molasses, caramel, and dark fruits appear in its place, with each note accompanied by an echo of bourbon, barrel, and booze. Mouth feel: The beer is certainly 'full' feeling, but the thickness lands more in the medium-thick territory. It is as though the density and gravity of the boozy alcohol note has stamped out the thickness, thinning it just a touch like some sort of liquor as opposed to a grain heavy barleywine. Effervescence is light. Overall: to be blunt, this was disappointing right out of the fridge - thankfully that all changed as the beer warmed. A pour or two of this beer were enjoyed near a kerosene heater, funny, as this beer could probably power that very same heater. Pretty remarkable, though after finally trying it, I would say it falls short of being an 'end game' beer for me. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 16oz can. Dec 31, 2024 Report",4.61

A mass of lager sized, saddle brown bubbles topped the liquid, but they quickly dissolved. The resulting body was shimmery and viscous and looked very similar to a spirit. After each sip, thick, sticky legs trickled down the sides of the glass. The aroma was really intense. Uber malty and robust. Super boozy and complex. Brown sugar and dark fruit notes came through big time. Huge booze soaked raisin presence. Loads of stewed plum character too. Woody bourbon and port notes were prevalent from start to finish. Good dose of vanilla as well. The alcohol presence continued to intensify as the beer warmed. The flavor profile mimicked the nose. Massively boozy and intense. Tons of dark fruit character. Like in the aroma, booze soaked raisins and woody bourbon notes dominated. Moderate roasted malt presence. Brown sugar was noticeable on the front end. Port notes appeared in the center. More boozy, oaky bourbon stave character on the back end and in the finish. Somewhat dry and tannic after the swallow. Sweet, boozy, bourbony notes and some woody char lingered. Nice rich, syrupy mouthfeel. Full bodied but definitely not quite as viscous as I anticipated for a beer of this magnitude. Loads of alcohol heat. The liquid contained a super fine, mellow effervescence that worked nicely for the style. A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged is unquestionably the most intense barleywine I have ever tried and an impressive example of the style. That said, the alcohol presence was extreme and a bit distracting. This is a beer that would likely be best enjoyed when split multiple ways with friends. Jul 08, 2024 Report",4.52

A 16 oz. can the likes of which I’ve never viewed, with the bottom of the can slathered in black wax. Funny, guys. The pour is dark, with minimal, tiny bubbles clinging around the edges of the circle. Smells boozy, thick, like some kind of chunky batter. A Deal with the Devil – Double Oaked harkens more towards III than I. The slyness of 1 is absent here, while the gullet-searing booze of III is popping. Cluster of bourbon greets the palate & it’s smooth, not harsh, an easy guest. Mid-palate is full, sweet, thick maltiness, anise, molasses, caramelized toffee. Belches bring up more delicious bourbon. Thick; close to sludgy. Neither that nor the future promise of a morning head-pounding would keep me from drinking a couple if I had them. Luckily, I do not. This series is ridiculously good & crazy pricey. But like the other pair I’ve sample, this is a top-tier brew. In other words: yummy. Apr 26, 2024 Report",4.82

Mostly sweet tasting but not overwhelming at all.  Nice oaky/woodiness lingering in the finish.  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Aromas of heavy leather guide to fig compote and gooey caramel, with toffeed roast and cocoa subtleties sink into resounding plum port, leaving charry barrel building through lingering overtones of red currant syrup. Taste offers a potent barrel overlay, coursing over a subtle cocoa dusting as is leather interspersed through the mid-palate and red currant syrup is leveled by a fervent oak backing into the finish. Mouthfeel shows a medium body with minimal carbonation, settling a slick texturing over the mid-palate as a pseudo-grit hovers in the backdrop; barrel tannins spark through the backend while an impressive warmth remains level across the entirety of the palate. Latent intensity perpetuates an exercise in indulgence, indulging unrepentant sweetness contained by massive barrel presence in a viscous liquid form; an American Barleywine testing the bounds of the style.

Head is reluctant, but slowly emerges with tight tan bubbles, almost like it’s nitro’d. Quiet nose, still dominated by alcohol heat, even after 6 years of aging. Pull your nose back from the glass, and you’re met with subtle vanilla, coconut and stewed dark fruits. Flavors are massive, and immediately hit you with boozy, oaky, tannic cognac bite. It evolves into dark caramel, toffee, bitter pecan, figs and vanilla. Just a huge barrel influence, with flawless blending to keep things in balanced. Sweetness is perfectly in check, and you’d never know it’s 17%. Mouthfeel is impossibly smooth with absolutely no alcohol burn. It’s perfect. Perfect birthday beer. Exactly the type of thing I love. Huge barrel character, tempered sweetness, tons of oaky vanilla. This beer laughs at 6 years of aging.. it could last 60. May 01, 2023 Report",

I have not had the base beer, but I recently came across this and the Triple Oak-Aged version. Considering this is review #1599 for me, I wonder what I'll choose for the milestone review #1600...Let's get into it Pours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing, but with fantastic legs The nose here is very sweet, but in no way overbearing, with much of the sweetness coming from dark fruit notes. I’m picking up on aromas of fig, dark chocolate, sweet bourbon, vanilla, black cherry, burnt caramel, charred oak, cognac, molasses, light port wine, and toasted walnut It keeps up the sweetness and the balance of said sweetness in taste despite some seriously boozy notes that come through, and somehow improves upon it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, sweet bourbon, brown sugar, raisin, toasted oak, vanilla, smoky tobacco, sticky caramel, light coconut, plum, and a touch of port wine. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, plum, port wine, burnt caramel, cocoa powder, raisin, sweet vanilla, charred oak, earthy bourbon, walnut, and the slightest hint of fusel alcohol A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick and boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry and seriously complex, and the booze actually works really well here for a perfect mouthfeel This is awesome. I'm not sure it's worth what it sells for, but who cares? It was great to get to try this nonetheless. With the second highest rated American Barleywine behind me, we all know what's next Apr 07, 2023 Report",4.54

Pours a crazy dark brown - almost black. A VERY thin layer of light brown head, but it's pretty much non-existent. Going into this one, I figured it would be boozy and intense, given the ABV. Let's find out. The nose is a BA barleywine on steroids. Holy crap. Super intense notes of Armagnac, brown sugar, bourbon-soaked toffee, figs, plums, raisins, tons of vanilla, and a hint of coconut. Dang this is a beast! After a couple of minutes of sipping on this, the bourbon barrel really shines through even more. At this ABV, I can almost transport myself to sniffing a Glencairn with Woodford bourbon in it. If you like bourbon, this is a barleywine for you! The taste is equally as intense, but not as balanced as the nose. Here the sharp bitterness kicks in, along with a strong sweetness. They are fighting for top spot. I think it's simply that the bourbon is so incredibly strong in this one that it overpowers the barleywine taste. Still, really nice notes of toffee, plums, raisins, vanilla, oak, clove, pine needles, mint, leather, slight coffee grounds, chocolate, molasses, and an earthy note. Even after a little while, it's still incredibly boozy. What's odd is that I love bourbon and I love barleywine, but they fight in an odd way in this one. Don't get me wrong, it's great, but it could have been a lot better (IMO) with a lower ABV. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the aftertaste is mostly toffee, booze, and an earthy/hoppy note. Overall, this is a good one, but loses some points for being slightly out of balance. Jan 21, 2023 Report",4.29

Inversely, a transitory adherence on suds, as the collar rebuffs retention in a hotfoot manner. The initial hue on the neck is a desert sand reflection, while the collapsed rim offers a wooded brown tinge. Just underneath, a body that’s been discharged to a raisin black wash with Charleston Green pathways, as the emissions transcript a tone near Byzantium. The output is short on ebullition, and thick on opacity, due to a circumstantial impartiality S: A strong timbered hop effect that’s confronted rigorously, by the concentrated malt profile, while the casks set a nearby perimeter. The directive is dense on implying a condensed coffee puck to the regions of Guatemala & Colombia, when connoting treacly dark fruits.

That provision is keen to address the colophony on pine, aside the sap on Sycamore, when supplementing the casks thru a sylvan terrain.

The barrels are fairly soft to characterize profoundly, yet systemize in duration per the warming pauses. Namely, a Heaven Hill depiction that’s works to address vanilla, while the Woodford Reserve paints the soft fruited spices in back. Successively, an awareness on amyl alcohols with clocked oxidation on the assist, for promoting a vinous quality near Malmsey. The sequences continue on against the open circulations, which front dried orange slices to a leathery nuttiness, while chronicling charred oak T: The barrel character plays on the bourbon casks, in a finer way than the oaked reserve, when first put into motion. Nonetheless, the kickoff is fairly calm on their sentience, as the rich bready chords vanguard the ordinance. One that navigates towards sticky toffee pudding, while addressing rich dark fruits, in the act of respecting the amalgamated – peppery – hop effect.  With that in mind, an earthy pillar that trudges schwarzwald mountains to find wild fruits, besides uncovering redcurrants & black sapote. An involved sensitivity that caramelizes the middle on marshmallows, while maintaining an epicenter on the fig to raisin presets, as a more appreciative resonance builds to the aftertaste. The later stages on conditioning are kinder to the phenolic aldehydes with a lactone softness, considering the vanilla oaked context. Thereby, implying the maltol characterizations that enhance malts acuity, before addressing charred furfurals. There’s an idling element on forested planks, as the barrels address the soft (baking) spices that credit nutmeg & clove.

The intensity of flavors makes this absolutely unique. The relatively short time in the barrels seems to leave the oaky depths and nuance behind in favor of a massive straight up bourbon presence. This works well with the strong toffee and raisin base. This does not represent my favorite approach to double barrel barleywine, I will continue to buy multiples of everything Kane offers at a fraction of the price while this is a one and done purchase.

Aroma bursts with rich caramel and toffee as soft tobacco tones and leather offers a delicate contrast to notes of maple hard candy and a sturdy background barrel influence. Taste brings Werthers Originals and waves of lightly smoked toffee into tobacco and subtle dark cherry undertones, leaving residual dark cocoa to contrast an ample char finish. Mouthfeel offers a full body and a moderate-high spritz of prickly carbonation; a taut roast underscores building barrel warmth over the mid-palate to flaky slickness and a vaguely sticky finish.

Body is lush and stupid smooth with plenty of booze backing.  Smell is the one area that is simpler than the orignal just because the barrels are so strong (and beautiful), fitting my conclusions of the beer: it is more potent and deep, but not as complex and drinkable, a very warm sipper that is so rewarding.

Date stamp is 12/29/2022. The beer pours a dark rich mahogany color into my glass. Only the lightest tints of light get through the glass. A fizzy beige head of 1 cm foams up but fades to a thin edge layer quickly after the pour.  The edging does stick around for most of the sampling. Aroma is toffee, brown sugar, some bourbony/rye sweetness, a bit of dry wooden barrel, almost like a popsicle stick note.  There are hints of fusol booze here too, but no hop notes that I can detect. First sip reveals a fairly robust body and syrupy texture.  Carbonation is fine and tingly, sticky coating on my palate after each sip.  Swallow reveals a bit of warmth on the finish.  Physical traits make this a sipping beer. Flavor is similar to what the nose predicts with malt forward character. I get toffee, brown sugar and general malt sweetness.  There is a rye/bourbon note that carries through for sure and I keep tasting maple syrup, even though I dont think thats an additive.  I dont get any hop character on this beer.  Booze is limited to warmth, with no peppery bite or spiciness. A sweeter sipping beer that I am enjoying and very happy to have had the chance to drink tonight while watching Dallas vs Seattle.

Dark burnt caramel color, minimal fuse-fast head. Aroma is unexpectedly heavy prune with a base of leather and light vanilla. First sips are laden with bourbon bite, I mean a heavy hit of hot but  enjoyably sweet spirit. The barrel wood is forward, bringing images of saturated staves oozing booze and tannins. I don’t even know the ABV but it’s easy to kick back a big swig…though I only have this one lonely can to enjoy. Mouthfeel is full, with a nice stickiness. The caramel bites are all over the middle and end flavors. It carries traits similar to a stout/barleywine cuvée, like Anchorage’s Endless Endings, wherein there is a dark malt middle flavor once the sip is gone and you’re enjoying the linger. I also find it similar to Fremont’s B6K, but with a much more subdued and harmonious sweetness profile. Next time, I’ll try to get a 4-pack. I had a meeting that day…in hindsight, it was with an asshole, so my time would have been better spent ordering beer online. Jun 15, 2023 Report",

Hill Farmstead doesn't go crazy with one flavor profile and that is embodied here. While labeled a NE IPA, is more caramel colored than hazy and tastes blend west coast and east coast styles, similar to Focal Banger. Definitely hoppy at the start but mellows with a malty, oaty finish. Partly hoppy and partly rustic, Abner is a expertly minimalist IPA. They do all the little things right. Jun 04, 2023 Report",4.59

I know they’re more known for their Saisons, but I’m very happy to try this Pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing For the style, this isn’t super juicy in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon, lemon zest, bready malt, light caramel, peppery hops, fresh grass, and grapefruit rind It’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, tangerine, overripe melon, weedy hops, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest, orange juice, bready malt, peppery hops, fresh grass, and light tangerine A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry and very balanced Holy shit, this is a great beer. Super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv. I need more Apr 06, 2022 Report",4.48

Poured a solid medium-dark orange color with a bit more than a half-inch of white head that had good retention and lacing. A big blast of hops popped out of the can upon opening. Some citrus-orange scents, and some light frootiness. Very low grain presence. Fairly similar on the tongue, with a bit of alcohol presence as well. The body was fairly typical for the style, smooth and light. Drinkability was good, especially sine the alcohol seemed to fade out a bit as it spent some time in the glass.

Canned on 01/24/25, so this beer is two months and a day old. Look: Pours a very nice copper color with fine-bubbled carbonation.  There was two fingers of a fluffy, off-white head that  eventually dissipated after leaving behind some nice lacing.  Nice clarity. Smell: Nice piney, earthy, peppery aromas with lots of orange rind and pithy grapefruit notes.  Candied orange peel.  Green bell pepper on the finish after swirling the glass. Taste: Very solid, this is a quintessential West Coast Double IPA to me.  Up front, it's very citrusy with a bit of sweetness and juiciness.  And then the piney bitterness comes quickly and fiercely (tastes like there's a lot of Chinook character here).  The bitter finish lingers long, and as it fades there is a caramel sweetness that eventually comes through like licking away the layers of a hard candy enrobed in bitter hop resins.  It's really delicious and highly drinkable.  Surprising that I have not seen this before, although I did review Double Sunshine - Ruby Red Grapefruit, which was also quite delicious. Feel: The mouthfeel is clean and it has a nice chewy, oily character.  Medium plus bodied. Overall: It doesn't get much better than this as far as a classic Imperial IPA goes.  Of course, it depends what you are looking for and this is what I am looking for as far as the style goes.  It's so clean and so flavorful.  Packs the piney, bitter punch that you are expecting and it also has the lovely citrus and caramel malt character that you crave in a West Coasty. It's been a couple of years since I tasted and reviewed Double Sunshine - Ruby Red Grapefruit and I'm not sure which one I like more.  I ended up giving them the same score.  This is obviously more classic, but I think that I may have enjoyed the other one slightly more.  It would be fun to do a side-by-side! Mar 25, 2025 Report",4.35

Things have certainly changed since then but I was ecstatic to find this nearby. It's been a while since I've had Sip of Sunshine but I honestly don't think it's much different than that. Slightly better maybe? Both are 8% and Citra-hopped. Does it live up to the hype considering I've waited 12 years to try it? Maybe not, but it's a fantastic beer. More West Coast than anything, with a bit of juiciness from the Citra. This is nothing like a NE style IPA, and that's fuckin fine with me! An excellent beer. Hope I can find it again someday.

This brew is roughly half way between New England and Westcoast style IPA's.  It balances its mild mannered juicy and bitter part well and is very drinkable too.  Excellent! Jan 29, 2025 Report",4.42

Double Sunshine,"Reviewed by Roguer from Connecticut 4.72 /5 rDev +1.9% look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75 Double Sunshine. The beer. The myth. The legend. The beer that spawned an entire series of Sunshine-themed (mostly) IPAs. Sip of Sunshine is one of the best shelf-available IPAs in the nation. Little Sip packs one heck of a punch for the ABV. Triple Sunshine is a legend in its own right. And on and on and on, each take fantastic in its own right. But Double Sunshine is really the OG. The flavor profile leans citrus-forward, but there's a hefty amount of pine, resin, and tropical fruit to provide balance. The malt base is clean and smooth. You'd likely never guess that both DS and SoS clock in at an identical 8% ABV; while the latter drinks like a single IPA (that will knock you on your ass), the former truly drinks like an imperial IPA. Double Sunshine is one of the purest expressions of an Imperial IPA - before the NE-style craze, but not aspiring to be a Pliny clone, either. Entirely worthy of the hype, and then perhaps some.

Double Sunshine,"Reviewed by Smakawhat from Maryland 4.69 /5 rDev +1.3% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75 Poured from the can into a Lawson's branded tulip/goblet glass.  Canned April 26th 2023. Beamin juicy orange colored body, with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation.  Three finger forming head, a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily, with light retention.  Still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well, making a nice crowned appearance. Delicious aroma.  Hop pressing front nose with light citrus, and faint touching juicy tropical notes.  A nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla, mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality.  Comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality. The mouthfeel on this is just unreal.  An intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate.  The mid hits with thick THICK controlled orange and pine notes, mixing sweet cream and orange, and pine/earth heat.  Bitterness comes in the finish, so ever slowly, with first notes of tangerine and Christmas spices, then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness.  Campfire like warmth in the back palate, that just slowly sits and churns with all the orange and spices you can imagine. Fantastic IPA, and hardly any hint of big abv now that I think of it.  Just killer stuff. Jun 27, 2023 Report",4.69

L: Pours a deep golden, yet clear in the glass. Fluffy, white head of 3 fingers lasts through the session. S: Smells of grapefruit, citrus, dank hops, and sweet bread malt. T: Grapefruit and sweet malt dominates the beginning, the hops come into play by this point and play very nicely with the grapefruit. These dank, citusy notes do not overpower and keep the beer tasting fresh. It finishes clean, especially for a DIPA. F: Nice level of carbonation, feels smooth and finishes clean. Incredibly drinkable for a session. Just be careful with DIPAs with this level of drinkability. O: Incredibly well balanced DIPA with an excellent flavor profile. This might be my favorite DIPA I have tried to date. Mar 09, 2023 Report",4.85

The soft, smooth, and velvety mouthfeel accentuates the creamy coconut much better than if this was simply more viscous/syrupy.

Some bubble gum notes as well (Double Bubble, maybe Juicy Fruit). Some green hop late, along with a little bit of booze. Feel is rather thick, carbonation is light.

Pill and ring lacing forming on a good slow sinking head, with lots of staying power.  Creamed and turbid looking body, a little custard yellow with touches of brown. Fantastic hop aroma.  Perfume like tropical notes of pineapple and mango, a faint touch of caramel malt, lemon to lime citrus oil, and some faint smokey earth.  Excellent nose that just whaffs of perfumed fruit bonanza. Shocking palate.  Classic and bold rich pineapple and juiced fruit in the mid palate, almost sillky like in feel.  But it's the finish that is the real winner and shocker of a surprise.  Ending and finish is full of a rich first mint, then bitter marmalade heat that just builds ever so slowly with the perfect amount of oily creep that hits out of nowhere.  Litteraly juiced herbs is the only way I can describe it, and the sensation is phenomenal.  Earth and mint perfume finish with matching tropical hop fruit.

Clover,"Reviewed by BillRoth from Maryland 4.87 /5 rDev +4.1% look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75 Purchased a bottle at HF @ Spring 2019. Bottle dated October 19, 2016. Considering the earliest reviews of Clover were in mid October 2016…I’m assuming this was from Batch 1. Regardless…I further cellared it and finally had it around Christmas 2024 and it was amazing. Extraordinary! Probably best saison if not best beer I’ve ever had. Gorgeous soft yellow with slight darkening to gold as it reflected to light. Huge plump white head that lingered and laced. Nose was full and expressive with lemon and field flowers, taste mirrored but brought out oak and a perfect gentle funkiness and just hints of barn loft in summer. These notes just added a sophisticated complexity to fruits and flowers. Stellar. Well rounded soft body with just right natural carbonation like a very high end champagne. I’ve been fortunate to enjoy wonderful saisons on site at Side Project; Russian River; DeGarde, Sante Adarius, and in Europe freshly poured from bottles, kegs and casks… let alone dozens of bottles of deservedly well regarded Belgians like Cantillion. Nothing prepared me for this.  So delicate So good. Definitely best Saison I’ve  ever had; probably best beer. Feb 11, 2025 Report",4.87

Clover,"Reviewed by Sabtos from Ohio 4.74 /5 rDev +1.3% look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75 Clear yellow-gold with minimal head formation dying to a clear, bubbly and uneven surface that disperses to a bubbly flat collar. The appearance was impressively identical between two different batches, which we were fortunate enough to enjoy in one evening. Starting with batch 2, the oak is very expressive, yet gentle at the same time, backed by reduced citrus juice characteristics like grapefruit, orange and lemon. This was a smaller pour than I had of batch 3, but the contrasts were stark, while the more obscure parallels somehow held firm. Out of batch 3, I perceive a larger presence of straw and young oak up front, but this quickly gives way to more acid than b2, while yet remaining palatably balanced. This acidity expresses like yellow raspberry and seedy passion fruit, countered by a frothy body that exhales refined oak threads. While that Ann oak in conjunction with the subtle funk of Art solidly affirm their support, it was clear that Flora's return to the blend saw her influence well exerted here. This has been a very long time coming for me, and contrary to most experiences with meeting your idols, this did not let me down. I came away preferring b3, though absent of overwhelming confidence, as they were both phenomenal in different ways. Mar 13, 2023 Report",4.74

No real lacing, though there is a temporary tight circle as I take a sip. The maple is noticeable a decent distance from the glass. Getting closer with my nose, a berry-rich coffee pinches through the sweeter notes, pushing them to the side quite a bit.  For roast, the edges have  singed toast and burnt marshmallow. First sip starts with one main sensation: sweetness;  maple-leaning on the opening, but it’s more just candy sweet. The dark roast and burnt marshmallow fill in before I swallow, but the more bitter notes are fighting harder for the palate than they had to for the nose.  Maple flavor comes out more distinctly late and into the finish. It reminds me of the maple leaf cookies from Canada. It pairs with the berry and coffee from the nose briefly. Eventually, a weak but bitter coffee from the bottom of the glass (with the last remaining sweetener). The feel is medium thick, with a large amount of stickiness. Carbonation is just enough to keep each sip rolling towards its intended destination. Jan 25, 2025 Report",4.43

Overpowering maple on the nose, and was  a little worried that this was going to be too sweet for me, and too much of a dessert stout, but the taste was so well balanced - maple sweetness was well calmed by the roasty coffee and baker's chocolate flavor. While MD was easier to obtain this year from a volume perspective, this was not a cheap bottle to get to Pittsburgh haha - overall - well worth it and while some of the shine might have worn off this beer nationally given it's more readily available, it's still a world class pour.

Any time I’m heading to New York I make a point to stop in there, and I always find good stuff that I can’t really find elsewhere. In addition to 2015 vintage 120 Minute IPA, they had this for fills. A successful trip there yet again. I’ve wanted to try this one for a while, currently sitting at #7 of the highest rated beers of all time on BA. I’m very excited to try this, so let’s crack it open Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing It’s not even a question that this is loaded with maple in the nose, but it feels very authentic. I’m picking up on aromas of maple candy, medium roast coffee, sweet caramel, nougat, milk chocolate, raisin, and vanilla creme In taste, it has an interesting vibe where it’s even more sweet, but also quite balanced in its sweetness. More or less sweetness from different notes working together well. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, marshmallow, sticky maple, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple candy, sticky caramel, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, toffee, and candied raisin A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a super slick beer. Finishes very sticky with a bit of boozy heat This is good no doubt, great even, but it is very sweet. Because of this, I can’t give it reslly anywhere near the average. A good beer, but there’s better options for this kind of thing Nov 05, 2021 Report",4.45

Unexpectedly, this features more wood and funk than fruit. It's quite mature, nutty, oaky and even dusty, with notes of cashew and walnut. At the same time, it's quite sour of white wine, apricots, green grape, lemon and mango vinegar (while at the same time avoiding acetic harshness). The moderate body has a soft then crispening fizz before coming to a semi-dry finish. While I was slightly underwhelmed by West Ashley, this is a marked improvement, and really in and of itself a fantastic saison. However, (while qualifying ahead of time that SARA has nothing to prove), for a saison showcasing a stone fruit such as apricot, it doesn't quite reach the heights of some of the greats. Fou Foune is already a tall hill to overcome, but even further, for me personally, de Garde is the king of the stone fruits, and just tower over everyone else. Nov 12, 2019 Report",

The apricot flavor just bursts forward here - with tongue-tingling sourness and drippy juiciness - it's so authentic and wonderful tasting. There's a lot of barrel too, wine slathered all over it, with some mildly tempering oak as well. There's also a sort of general sour citrus character, as well. This is light bodied, and pretty high on the sour scale - personally, maybe an 8/10. It's still pretty drinkable despite that. I'm not 100% sure this is better than regular 'ol West Ashley.

The carbonation is gentle, creating a soft glow in the glass that makes it look as luscious as it tastes. The aroma is an absolute fruit bomb, showcasing waves of tropical and citrus fruits. Juicy mango, papaya, and pineapple lead the charge, followed by a punch of orange zest and tangerine. Subtle floral and piney hop notes lurk in the background, but the fruit-forward character dominates. On the palate, JJJuliusss delivers an even bigger burst of flavor than its aroma suggests. Bright citrus flavors like orange, grapefruit, and tangerine blend seamlessly with tropical notes of mango, passionfruit, and guava. The malt backbone adds a subtle sweetness, balancing the intense hop profile without overshadowing it. The hop bitterness is more pronounced compared to its siblings, giving the beer a bold, resinous edge that complements the juicy fruit flavors perfectly. The mouthfeel is full and pillowy, with a luxurious, creamy texture that coats the palate. The carbonation is moderate, offering just enough fizz to keep it lively without detracting from its smoothness. The finish is slightly dry.

The excellence in Jjjuliusss is felt starting with a similarly creamy peach and golden blend of colors and airy textures as the original Julius. The beer's dense and foggy appearance only works to make it more appetizing. A slow separation of ale from froth suggests a viscous character that carries over to an even more creamy, tangy, sweet and fruity taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and piney perfume than any before. Less grassy and herbal in taste, the flavors that explode on the middle palate are dominant with all-things-orange. Tangerine, in all its tangy, fructose-sweet, branch-ripe and fresh squeezed vibrance springs to life with a zesty support of red grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting taste, a sense of bitter sherbet with citrus zest apply their final and lasting contributions to balance. Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts fuller and plush, but trailing bitter, herbal and dry, the soft sappiness of freshly shaven spruce links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative texture and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns itself with sorbet desserts- Its surprising that a single sixteen ounce can can hold so much flavor.

Aroma highlights mango gummies accented with a slight mustiness hinting toward a boggier overlay of guava peel and tropical compost over time; a dense, bready malt backing remains prevalent as light papaya and melon brings a soft freshness to the back end. Taste offers mossy mango contrasting tangy orange juice upfront, with lingering guava engaging distant melon over the mid-palate while sweet, boggy-dank sensations flow alongside a lime-pineapple juiciness on the back end. Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a moderate, rounded carbonation soon easing to resoundingly creamy, smooth textures; a juicy twang levels density past the mid-palate to an effortless, pillowy grit lingering on the finish. A tropical hop smoothie, extensively creamy and leveled with weighty resins in-flux with the rampant saturation; a busy density attenuated to Tree House's usual high standard of NEIPA.

""JJJuliusss"" 16 fl. oz. can coded ""JJJUST GGGREAT  04/29/22  07:48:00"". Sampled on 05/15/22 Notes via stream of consciousness: The can that I have in front of me is labeled JJJuliusss without an exclamation point and the label is white, not orange, but I'm pretty sure this is the same beer. The question is, what is it? I get all of these Julius beers confused. Ahh, this is Julius with extra hops added, first brewed for their 3rd anniversary. It's poured a very cloudy orange body beneath a finger's width of creamy off-white foam. As is the case with all Treehouse beers the head holds up really well and it leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. That hasn't happened yet but I can tell that it will based on experience. The aroma is fruity but also malty. It's sweetish and grainy with notes of orange, peach, and mango. I wish I had a Julius to compare it to but I drank them all! Ha ha! The flavor delivers that sweetish malt and I can taste the oasts in it. It's threaded through with notes of orange, peach, mango, melon, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine. It's got a median bitterness but also a lot of acidic ""hop bite"" that balances it and eventually leads to a dry finish where resin and pine linger. In the mouth it's medium bodied but fluffy and smooth due to all of the extra proteins. As expected the head held up well and I now have craggy rings of lacing throughout the entire glass. I honestly can't say how much more aromatic or flavorful this is than the standard Julius but I think I enjoyed it more. I'll have to try to get a hold of more of both to do a side-by-side.

Great retention and thick rings of lacing. Big orange in the nose.  Hints of passionfruit, plum and gummy bears. Same lovely mix of tropical fruits and orange citrus in the taste.  A little herbal greeness and light pith in the finish creates some great balance that prevents the beer from being sweet. Very soft, pillowy feel with restrained carbonation. A top of class NEIPA.  Tons of depth among the varied fruit flavors along with good light bitterness for balance. Feb 21, 2022 Report",4.38

Mostly orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Medium sweetness with a zesty, slightly bitter finish. Feel: Full and juicy. Low carbonation. Slightly sharp. Overall: Typical Tree House IPA which could easily be mistaken for a higher ABV DIPA (which is great). Rather edgy than smooth, but still nicely balanced.

A: Poured from the bottle into a Tree House tulip. Body is slightly hazed golden with a wisp of whitish head on top. Nice splotches of lace left behind. S: Nice old-school DIPA nose - think ripe oranges, honey-sweet malt, and a touch of pine. T: Sweet bready malt foundation is followed by oranges, candied orange peels and then a touch of woodsy/pine bitterness. No indication of the 8.2% ABV at all, other than a hint of heat in the belly. M: Medium-to-heavy in weight, a tad bit syrupy in feel. O:  It's a nice representative version of the DIPAs I drank 12-15 years ago, before the Hazy/New England-style IPAs took over. A real nice sipper, brings back the old ""feels"" of sitting on the laptop while reviewing a DIPA and enjoying each sip. Aug 19, 2025 Report",4.46

The head fades over a moderate level of time, leaving a touch of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is strong of tropical fruit smells of pineapple, mango, and papaya, along with a good showing of orange and tangerine.  Other smells of a bready and doughy smell mixed with some light spice and some notes of pepper and lemon are there as well, mixed with some notes of melon and a good showing of pine and herb. Taste - The taste begins similar to the nose, with flavors of a bready malt mixed with some flavors of tropical fruit of mango, pineapple and tangerine.  The hop is present right from the start, heaviest in pine and herb, but containing notes of a grapefruit and floral hop as well.  As the taste advances a bit of wood and some light notes of grass, vanilla, and hay join in, all while the malt and the hop grow a bit stronger, leaving one with a rather nicely hopped and somewhat more malty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the slightly chewier and thick side with a moderate level of carbonation.  For the style and the tastes, the feel is nice and makes for a dangerously easy sipper. Overall – A rather nice imperial hazy. Big flavor, but good balance.  Not as spectacular as the reviews may suggest, but overall quite good and well crafted. Update: 6/26/24 Had this from the bottle as well.  Born on date of 05/21/24 so only 36 days old.  Very similar to the brew above.  Good solid brew. Apr 13, 2024 Report",4.29

Slightly hazy bright orange golden pour with a finger and a half of uniform tight white head. Aroma is absolutely killer - tropical fruit - pineapple, ripe orange, orange peel, piney and a bit sweaty. Just a little bit herbal with a whiff of green onion. Sweet upfront with the pineapple, ripe orange, and tangerine but with a decent blast of piney and resinous hops and an herbal bitterness at back - perfect balance of fruity sweetness and pungent bitterness. Medium full mouthfeel with bright carbonation - goes down with a sticky bittersweetness that lingers nicely. Fantastic. Oct 06, 2023 Report",

Aroma is a wonderful spiced orange.  Juiced Christmas mandarin nose, with hints of spice and leafy green sensing hops.  Soft bodied and creamy vanilla sensing malt to match make an impressive hop nose. Palate is richly good, but no surprises.  Creamy sensing body along with the flavors, if anything its mouthfeel is the most impressive.  Mid palate rich in peeled and juiced orange tangerine notes.  Finish accentuates soft green herbs, to an almost minty finish but a more pungent flavor, and sharper astringency like a soft pine.  Still manages great balance keeping soft vanilla like flavored sweetness, and that classic Creamsicle orange like flavor. It's not that exotic or dynamic, just a solid ipa done with exceptional base flavors.  Very nice! Jul 26, 2023 Report",4.51

The aroma literally jumps out of the glass on this beer; it has an essential oil like brightness to it, incredibly vibrant. A mix of fresh in season fruits; nothing tropical to me just local summer fruits, but with an extra citrus like bite to it; a little bit of vegetal dank on the finish, it cuts short of onion garlic territory for me. Taste is much of the same but the beer becomes less fruity more citrus, pithy, with a pretty nice minor sweet malt presence; slight resin/sap aftertastes. This is a double IPA that is for sure; it has a pretty hefty body, higher end of medium. A very clean drinking beer, dry and biting bitterness on the finish, prickly sappy tingling on the tongue. Also letting you know this is a double IPA is the slight alcohol presence on the finish, no overbearing by any means but present. Well it is easy to see why this beer has the reputation it does. The aroma alone is intoxicating but the flavors and feel combine to make this a very good beer; I love the bite and big hop presence on such an aromatic beer. Lovely beer. Sep 04, 2022 Report",4.47
Dinner,"Reviewed by Roy_Hobbs from Connecticut 4.14 /5 rDev -10.4% look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4 I've never come across this highly regarded beer, so was pleasantly surprised to see it on tap when I was out to dinner last night.  The appearance was that of.....beer.  Cloudy and medium yellow, with almost no head.  The lack of head could certainly be chalked up to the fact that it had probably been a minute or two between the pour and its arrival at my table.  Regardless, while there was nothing wrong with the appearance, nothing particularly stood out either. The nose was a different story.  I'm desensitized to IPA aromas at this point, but this beer smelled amazing Loads of citrus, mango and other tropical notes. Simply an excellent smelling beer. The taste was very nice, but not as tropical as the nose.  Grapefruit was the only taste I could pick out, but whatever else was there it was above average, but didn't blow me away (keeping in mind I'm not a big lover of IPAs).  The feel, however was amazing.  Very full, creamy and pillowy.  Absolutely excellent. Overall, I though this was a very good beer, led by the aroma and the feel.  I hope to be able to luck into some bottles sometime right around a NBS BIF so I can share it with others. Sep 04, 2022 Report",4.14

Served in a spiegelau IPA glass. Pours a just barely hazed honey-gold with two-plus fingers of pouffy, shaving cream-like foam. Retention is excellent, leaving a fat bubbly-sudsy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing. Nose is sweet, malty, and layered with aromas of orange peel and pine needles. Taste is as expected, leaning into the sweet and malty end of balanced. The earthy-woody pine needle, resinous character is prominent, along with caramel sweetness, oily orange peel and a squeeze of lemon. Feel is clean, just a little too brisk to pass as smooth (entirely in a good way) and no more than medium bodied with bright, zesty carbonation. There’s a cheerful hop oily tingle on the tongue and a slight boozy warmth in the gullet. As always when rating MBC bottles, overall score is marked down 0.25 in recognition of the stupid, overpriced pint-plus bottles. Because principles, right?

The latticework suffers from the negative – appropriate – materials, but there’s a residue leeway using gentle agitation. This necessities at the launch, which is hastily cut inside the minute(s), as a new nuance defines the drippy – cathedral – windows S: The blend plays to the barrels with an accompany netting over the malts, while thickly layering esters atop hop sanities. Chiefly, a presence on acetates that pushes a solvent characteristic above the finer points, as they struggle – against epoxy – at the outset. Nonetheless, an oak derivative that midriffs on furfurals, which benefit the grain bill, by advancing the sweet caramel notations around Colomba di Pasqua. The road has a Rabitos Royale cusp with a cherry cordial prompt, as sultanas devise Boerenjongens. Moreover, a chord on orange blossom honey, which pursues a robust earthiness, while transmitting coniferous woodlands. This simulates treks covering Douglas Fir & Scots Pine trees, while natural Copal resins air above. Subsequently, a balmy increment to the hour, for attuning burnt sugar toffee to the skins of grapes, as the schedule concatenates on ethyl hexanoates. Namely, aniseed upon sundried apples, while the cask to malt ratio encompasses an oak plank grit on Moravian Wafers. The ventilation across the clocked periods delivers caved Moscatel congruities, which meld Raisin Marmalatas into eucalyptus shrubs. In due course, a @ > 80°F that sticks an aridness on guaiacols over beeswax, while a meerschaum presence stains vintage – vinylon – coats T: An isoamyl octanoate shadow to the deeply drawn hemicelluloses, where the oak structures pitch lipid derivatives. There is a solvent continuation, which is calmer than the odors let on, yet a paint to wood varnish – remnant – remains over the initial records. The direction incorporates Daim bars to German nougat sweets, as Vínartertas concoct. Underneath, a drawing on teakwood, by a deciduous nature, beyond vanilla agroforests. Secondly, a recognition – of the diastatic enzyme conversions – that benefits the malt saccharifications over maple crème caramels, while drawing on Peruvian coffees. There is an earthy hop poise to the residual sweetness, which lends a woodsy bite to the course. In doing so, the blend advances without choking, and furthers the development behind acetates, as tied to the cask enhancements. A development that’s constantly subjected to the °F upticks, as open air addresses the carafe, for an oxidized maturity outside the porous wood doings. In this situation, the process provokes vintage Armagnacs, where peculiar leathers top candid fruits, besides dated mink boots against flue-cured tobacco. A continuation that hints at shabby – masonry – chimneys, while phenolic compounds deliver eugenols over the charred lactone sentients M: A texture that delineates a sharp bite across barbed resins, which imbalances the kick-off. Coupled with, tannin constitutions, for elevating (& refining) dry executions against a soft glutinousness. As such, a dexterity with a sensitive viscosity through a warming decree, yet careful on the inebriant malaises, as carbonation brings a soft effervescence. The output lends a harmonic bitterness with a greenery balance, by the phased hop pillars O: Emphasizes the 26mths to 19mths with a warm barrel perceptiveness, which is slightly furthered outside the necessary transfers, considering a start that battles to make inroads.

Whatever the fuck we wanna call it, I’m beyond excited to try this so let’s get into it After a long and annoying struggle with the double cork breaking inside the bottle, it pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing Wow, this is super bright in the nose, just an absolute. punch of funk. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, sharp oak, old leather, wet hay, vinegar, apple skin, dried apricot, tart white wine (surprising given the red wine barrel aging), and general floral notes. Really all over the place but fantastic While it's not as incredible in taste, it is still very damn good, just less sharp than you'd expect based on the aroma. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting wet hay, lemon zest, jammy apricot, white wine vinegar, pear, white pepper, dry oak, and light leather.

So I was doing consulting work in SoCal in 2009.  Gueuze wasn't my thing; I'd never had a sip in 40 years of fine beer drinking. My son informed me that the Lost Abbey was putting out this Duck Duck Goose beer that Saturday, that his friend would have donated his right arm to be there, and could I pick up a bottle for his friend.  It was a bit of a hike from where I was to where the beer was, and I'd have to stay the weekend to boot.  His friend is a good guy, so sure, I'll stay. I arrived early for the opening, or so I thought. A very long line snaked through the parking lot 90 minutes before release time, and I took my place. I remember the sun was beating down from a cloudless sky, and I was getting an unanticipated sunburn atop my head. Finally I heard a cheer from the front of the line that quickly snaked by me to the end of the line (I couldn't see it.)  There was a 2 bottle limit on purchases, which initially bummed me out (this was the first time I waited in a beer line in 30+ years.)  However, inside the warehouse a bar was set up and they were serving healthy pours of DDG. My initial impressions were negative, as in ""what is this?""  But as I made my way to the bottom of my Solo cup, it started to grow on me.  I was able to get a second pour - same cup - and this one I took my time to savor.  I've been drinking gueuze til today. And the friend: he ended up getting both bottles with my compliments. He repaid me years later with a bottle of Kate the Great. Both of us are older, life's gotten in the way so neither of us follow beer as we used to, until for me anyway COVID has reintroduced me to BA. Hopefully beer follies will begin anew, and I'll be standing in a few more beer lines. May 17, 2020 Report",4.05

Smoothly tart green apple, lemon and grapefruit pair with a light sweetness from the red wine barrel, which also contributes a distinct red grape flavor. The medium body is a little silky and lightly crisp, easily continuing to develop a mild but splintery neutral oak that brings out accents of apricot and toasted sesame before a lightly stinging semi-dry finish. This would be killer with a ton of apricot in it, as DDG really reminds me of Fou, or at least what its base might be. --- We enjoyed a 2016 vintage in the fall of 2021, and appearance was clearer, while the taste was woodier with a superbly nutty funk. However, taste also had a touch of butter, while also being more acidic, with a touch of white wine vinegar.

I purposely saved this one for this landmark review since I reviewed the base version and the imperial version a few weeks back. This has been a long time want of mine, and luckily I was able to get the whole series at once. This bourbon barrel-aged variant has been sitting at the highest rated Imperial Porter for a long time on BA, and #38 overall. Let’s see if it lives up to the hype Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing The bourbon is definitely present in the nose, making the whole thing quite a bit sweeter but still really good. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, charred oak, salty bacon, medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, maple syrup, burnt caramel, and light brown sugar It’s an absolute smack in the face of every single element in taste, wow. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting smoky bacon, milk chocolate, maple candy, sweetened coffee, sweet bourbon, raisin, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, and caramel.

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Reviewed by HorseheadsHophead from Colorado 4.21 /5 rDev -8.7% look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4 Gushed a bit when I got opened the bottle.  I hope the carb is intact. It's a murky dark brown color, bordering on black at its darkest point, but the highlights are a lighter shade brown rather than ruby.  It's like the color of banana bread crust. Not much visible carbonation in the glass.  The head is small, beige, creamy, and patchy.  The head doesn't seem to dissipate at all; it was just never that big to begin with.  But it's sticky, latte-like froth, and swirly. Upon further swirls, it generates a larger head that stays. Alcohol tickles my nostrils immediately with warmth.  Prune and fig stands out, dried cherry and raisin, allspice, clove, and hay.  A bit of overripe banana, banana bread, some type of woodsy bark, perhaps oak and tannins.  Gives off red wine vibes.  Upon another whiff and thought, huge tobacco aroma, with perhaps a touch of vanilla.  There's some sweet caramel and toffee or butterscotch that melds seamlessly with dark brown bread and banana.  Think of it as dried and musty stone fruit trail mix in a cigar humidor with baking supplies.  It smells like it's from a cellar.  Amazing.  Perhaps it's the power of suggestion, but it smells like it came from a monastery. The taste is more subdued than the nose.  Interesting.  It tastes very strong and almost boozy.  It tastes like bourbon soaked raisin, banana bread, some prune, and large amounts of clove and pepper.  Some hay and oak tannins.  The alcohol warmth takes over the palate and lingers with heat. The mouthfeel is smooth, silky, creamy.  It coats the palate.  The carbonation isn't extremely high compared to other Belgians, but it moves the beer on the palate nonetheless.  The palate is left feeling sticky with some residuals sugar and ethanol, though not overly so.  It's not cloying at all.  Dries off quite a bit.  The alcohol taste lingers. Overall?  Well, of course, I'm grateful to have ever tried this.  This was my number one whale.  So my prejudice preceded me.  It is very good, but arguably, not any better than some of the other widely available quads.  In fact, I'd say some of them are equal or better.  But this is still great, and what an experience!

However, this year I had my chance when we vacationed in Antwerp. So I made the 2 hour drive to Westvleteren and located In de Vrede across from the Abbey. We had lunch, sampled a glass of 12 and the Blonde. Both were fabulous, but the 12 by far is at the top. Not only did it live up to my expectations it was the finest Trappist Ale I have ever tried. I picked up a couple of 6-packs to bring home to the US to enjoy over the next few months. The aroma after the pour is slightly nutty. The beer is very smooth, has a great flavor without the strong alcohol feel as with many other Belgian beers. It is by far the most satisfying beers I have tasted. Sep 30, 2023 Report",
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Reviewed by TheMadJack from Virginia 4.41 /5 rDev -4.3% look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75 Purchased a 2023 bottling in 2023. Poured at cellar temperature into a wine glass as my goblet did not survive a move. Vigorous head on pour half filled my glass with fluffy, off-white foam like a well-made cappuccino. Excellent retention and it took a long time to settle enough to pour a proper glass. Beer is a ruddy brown with tawny highlights. Some haze and fine carbonation. Immediate malt on opening, like walking into a bakery. Warm, whole grain type bread. Putting my nose into the glass, my impression is of balance. It's subtle and difficult to pull out specific notes, but I get cherry, a bit of almond, orange peel, and a light mineral aspect. The expected regional notes of banana and clove are present but subdued Taste is the expected clove and banana, plus brown sugar, cardamom, cream. Back notes of coffee beans and mineral water. Mouthfeel starts out with a Sprite-like effervescence calming to a velvety, creamy texture from the head. Drinkability? Yeah, it's drinkable. If you can get ahold of enough of it to have a session, sure, you could do it. But after only one bottle I can already tell I'm starting to miss subtleties that I picked up at the beginning. Much more affordable beers to tie one off with. But for any Beer Advocate, this is a bucket list item worth checking off the list. Aug 25, 2023 Report",4.41

It was definitely kind of expensive, but not as expensive as I was expecting. On a cold, snowy, lonely night...it seemed the perfect idea. It definitely looks as beautiful as any beer I have seen. Deep, dark and mystical. And I remember the aromas being similar...deep and mystical...and complex. I remember it being mega smooth. My initial impression was that this is much better than Rochefort 8 and 10. Much much better. As I have never been a fan of either. This has much more complexity, and is less creamy...and kind of dark and full of different flavour sensations that are difficult to put into words. However as I am reviewing from memory, I will need to review again when I actually have one with me when I am writing. So yes, this is kind of a vague review, but I don't remember liking it more than a mega amazing West Coast IPA, or even a Chouffe IPA. It was kind of like a Chimay Bleu but wth much more complexity. So these ratings are my approximated memories. Ciao Jun 10, 2023 Report",4.17

The ""Westy"" is the Unicorn of Beers. I bought 48 Bottles (2 crates) at the Abbey in Dec 2017. Still have about 15 bottles left. Its been interesting experiencing them age over time. They are still drinking well, but IMHO I think they peaked after about 3 years. I did a side by side tasting party in 2019 including beers from all 6 Belgian Trappist Ales (Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Bleue, Rochefort 10, Orval, Achel Brune, Westvleteren 12(St Sixtus Abbey), and others (St Bernardus 12, Leffe Brune, La Trappe Quad).  Many of these are excellent, but the Westy 12 was head and shoulders above the rest in terms of overall complexity and quality. I agree with many of the tasting notes posted before and I wouldn't do it justice to try, but I will say if you enjoy the strong quad style do yourself a favor and try one. OBTW I had to call and hit about 500 busy tones before finally getting through to a Monk and placing my order in 2017; and I had to go in person to the Abbey to pick them up.  I believe they now have a website that you can order for delivery. Check their calendar for times and details. Apr 27, 2023 Report",4.94

Bottle was 3 years old when I opened it. Pours quad colour. Brown with some red tint and a ton of big particulates clearly visible. Smells like biscuit, sweet bready yeast, apricot, a little caramel but not the oxidised kind, some herbal notes but no spice. Tastes amazing, Tons of that bready Belgian yeast at the start and lots of nice roasted biscuit from the malt. More fruit comes through on the palate than the nose and its integrated very well. Just sweet enough. The finish is bittersweet and dry. There's maybe the faintest hint of alcohol but it's hard to tell for me. Mouthfeel is good. The gravity works here. I can definitely see why people say Rochefort 10 is more complex, but I think my personal taste aligns with this quad more. The bottle I had lacked that ""spice"" character you get from a lot of abbey quads and I'm not sure if that's due to age or just the recipe itself. In any case, I personally enjoyed this beer more than R10 and Abt 12. Definitely stop by the monastery if you happen to be near Belgium. Dec 16, 2022 Report",4.75

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Reviewed by LiquidAmber from Washington 4.78 /5 rDev +3.7% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5 Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a slightly hazy, very dark orange with a fine, one finger light khaki head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt, dried plums, raisins, dates and a hint of licorice. Flavor is caramel and biscuit malt, figs, dates, raisin bread and leather. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Wow, finally got a bottle of this classic, a 2016 (bb 2019) bottling. I really wanted to try this next to a St. Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10, the latter my all time favorite quad and top rated beer all round. The best I could do to match the ages was a 2018 bottle of St. Bernardus and a 2013 bottle of Rochefort, but if not scientific, it will at least be enjoyable. I was actually expecting this to taste most like the St. Bernardus, because somewhere I read they used similar recipes. To my surprise, the Westy quite a different malt flavor, with some dry biscuit flavors (perhaps more date than biscuit) reminiscent of old ales melded to the brighter fruit I expected. Both the St. Bernardus and Rochefort had somewhat darker head color and a more reddish orange compared to the orange in the Westvleteren. The darkness of the rich colors and fine bubbles in the long lasting heads where similar in all three. Although the Rochefort has always won my side by side, this time I found the St. Bernardus to have brighter, more complex flavors. Perhaps the age mellowing has tempered the Rochefort too much (although I still have some older ones I find still enjoyable). As much as I love the classic dark fruit character of the St. Bernardus and Rochefort, I'm completely won over by the Westvleteren; it adds a malty depth to the fruit flavors that I find irresistible. I'm a skeptic and anything with a lot of hype combined with scarcity always make me prepared to be a bit underwhelmed, but in this case, I understand why this quad is so legendary. I would definitely be buying this regularly even if I had to drive to an abbey to buy it. A legendary classic that lives up to its reputation. I look forward to trying the Westvleteren 8 I picked up at the same time, although it is the same vintage and may not have held up as well. Nov 13, 2022 Report",4.78

For this milestone review, I obtained the absolutely legendary Westy 12, the highest rated Quad on BA and #46 overall. A long time want of mine (over 3 years), so I finally decided to pull the trigger and get some shipped from Belgium.  This is not as fresh as I hoped to try it, but I’m sure it hasn’t faded all that much. Let’s get into it Pours a cloudy medium brown/red with 2 fingers of creamy light tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing It’s super fruity in the nose, with a huge booze and yeast complexity to it. I’m picking up on aromas of red grape, dates, brown sugar, port wine, nutty malt, earthy toffee, molasses, clove, and light red apple Oh man, in taste it is much more malt driven, but it’s still plenty fruity and complex. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pumpernickel, red grape, sweet caramel, peppercorn, baked apple, brown sugar, clove, toasted nuts, and light port wine. The swallow brings notes of sweet booze, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, pumpernickel, port wine, clove, baked apple, leather, and light tobacco A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes slightly with a huge complexity that dries over time Wow. I just had to give this one a bump in the overall. So unique and ever changing, it’s addicting. I’m so happy I picked up a 6 pack of this whale, and happy to finally have it in the books Sep 23, 2022 Report",4.56
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Reviewed by AzfromOz from Australia 4.7 /5 rDev +2% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75 Found randomly in the fridge at Beer360 in Richmond, Australia in November 2021.  The proprietor told me there were a number hidden away in the fridge to see if anyone found them and realised what they were.  I sure as hell did! This review is based on some hastily scribbled notes, so might be somewhat sparse in comparison to the complexity presented by this wonderful beer.  The beer was drunk in April 2022. In the glass, the beer presents a burnt, muddy brown, pushing towards over-ripe, bruised plum in colour.  There's a thin, off-white head. The aroma is dark cherries, brown sugar, plum, red fruits, dark cherry and Christmas cake. The taste is complex and ever-changing.  There are dark fruits, red fruits, brown sugar and booze at first, and as the beer warms it moves to liqueur, cough syrup, sweet licorice and dark Christmas cake, with the booze backing off.  There is almost certainly more peeking through, but everything intermingles so well together it's hard to identify specific notes in the overall melange. The mouthfeel is full and smooth. Overall, there's a reason this is so sought after. It's my second-highest-rated beer on Untappd (behind KBS) and, without looking, I suspect it will be my highest on BA.  It's also the most expensive beer I've ever bought, coming in at around $55AUD for a 330ml bottle, which is about $48 more than an average beer!  Nevertheless, it's grabbed without hesitation every time I see it. Cheers! Aug 09, 2022 Report",

A: Very aggressive pour yields viscous black liquid and 3.5 fingers of brown head. Superb retention, and it barely budges in height throughout the session. Chunky and Webby lacing. S: mocha top note. Sweet smell of corny bourbon. Woody and oaky. Chewy dark caramel and bourbon ball candy. Fudge and toffee. Chocolate sauce and salted caramel. Slight earthiness. Kiss of smoke. Subtle fruit skins and more layered coffee. T: chocolatey up front with a wave of fudge sauce. This gives way to a strong pull of salted caramel. Brown bread and toasted crust. Slightly more acrid notes of smoke and soot. Barrel hits a little bit early on the mid-palate with corny sweetness and some alcohol heat. Woody oak. Bourbon ball candy with more chewy caramel. Waves of rich layered coffee flavors ebb and flow throughout the experience. Finishes with a lot of smoke and barrel, and a little lingering alcohol heat. M: Thick and Rich in body with a sense of heft. Chewy but not sludgy. Creamy and somewhat mousse-like. Moderately carbonated with a light prickle around the tongue. Alcohol warmth and and some oak tannin. O: Good complexity coming from the coffee alone, and it meshes very well with the underlying beer. The only real critique I have is that the barrel makes things stray a bit to the hot side. It does become a little bit of a distraction. I've had this beer on tap enough to know that this feels like batch variation. Normally it's superb and I don't ever recall noticing an unpleasant heat. Jan 12, 2025 Report",

Nose is a bit spicy - warming spices, with a slight sugary sweetness.  Getting a little roasted coffee and a hint of booze. Taste starts sorta sweet, and I’m a bit concerned.  But coffee and roasted malt push that back pretty quickly.  I think it’s the barrel aging that is bringing a little spice.  As I sip I get bourbon in front and back, with a light tang developing.

Pours a pitch black color. Typical of a barrel aged beer, the dark tan colored head is both bubbly and quick to fade, though duration is slightly better than the norm. The aroma is seriously mind-blowing - it reminds me of Goose Island's Bourbon County coffee stout, but everything seems more refined and delicate. The coffee in particular is an aromatic highlight, though there's still a nice presence of roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut, and oak. That coconut aspect is something I love in a bourbon barrel aged stout, so I'm glad to see it here in full force. While it's undoubtedly one of the best smelling stouts I've sampled, the flavor is a step down. Then again, a step down from a *5* is still a fantastic place to be. Frankly, I can't deny the complexity of the flavor profile .It immediately opens up with some vanilla and a wisp of dark fruit, building to more vanilla, some roast, coconut, and dark chocolate in the middle, while finishing with light coffee and oak barrel. About the worst I can say is that the taste is ever-so-slightly less cohesive than the nose - which isn't saying much, as the balance is still impeccable. It's a beer that tells a story, and that's rare even from GREAT stouts. The mouthfeel is the only aspect (at least the only one that matters, ""LOOK"") that falls short of true excellence. It's slick, oily, and slightly angular; I personally wanted creamy, soft, yet evaporative. Then again, the oak tannins make it nice and dry, though there is a boozy touch, as expected from 13.6% ABV. Carbonation is also slightly above average by the standards of the style. Drinkability is quite good, though why would you want to drink this quickly? It's an elite tier BA stout that deserves your full, undivided attention. It manages to stand out from others in the style, which is hard to do. If the mouthfeel was even better, this would be godly. Still, it's an absolute must-try that should be sought after. Aug 05, 2024 Report",4.47

First of all Speedway Stout and its variants are amongst the darkest stouts I've encountered. Due to the barrel aging and higher ABV there is only a deep brown head for a few fleeting moments before it dissipates to nothing. Vietnamese coffee works really well in beer, IMO -- it's rich, nutty, and inviting in the aromas without coming across as syrupy or stale. Also getting strong wet barrel notes, vanilla, coconut, black licorice, cacao powder, and burnt brownie ends. Melted coffee ice cream comes to mind as well. The taste largely follows the nose. There's a lot of the same rich, nutty coffee notes and they are balanced by the intensity of the roasty, herbal base stout and the rye and bourbon notes from the barrel aging. Unlike with the base stout, the mouthfeel leans more oily than velvety. Overall a long time want and this did not disappoint 91/100 Jan 18, 2024 Report",4.52

Nose is vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, chicory; as it warms, more wood and bourbon aromas. Taste has leather and tobacco up front, dark chocolate, wood and bourbon spice; sweetened black coffee. Bourbon character masks much of the coffee here, however, along with some of the sweet vanilla notes I recall from the non-BBA version. Mouthfeel is moderate with low carb, nowhere near as thick as and chewy as other contemporary stouts at this ABV. A good beer, but definitely prefer the non-BBA version. Nov 26, 2023 Report",4.12

The head quickly dropped to a thick, clingy, lasting collar. Some patchy lacing trickled down the sides of the glass after the first few sips. On the second pour, a bit of yeast sneaked into the liquid, clouding the body ever so slightly. The aroma was impressive though fairly straightforward. Super crisp and bright. Dry, powdery yeasty notes were apparent initially, but they went away as the head dissolved. The resulting liquid was moderately tart and slightly funky. Bit of fruity sweetness. The raspberry presence was subtle but noticeable. Hint of dry oaky-ness. There was an interesting floral quality that reminded me of lavender and presented as somewhat soapy. The flavor profile was similar to the nose but more acidic and not quite as interesting. Tart up front. Fairly acidic but not excessively so. Touch of raspberry. Lemon notes appeared in the center. Lots of crisp wheatiness as well. More tartness and acidity on the back end and the finish. There was a subtle dry, oaky barrel presence as well. The mouthfeel was solid. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a finely beaded,  subtle effervescence gave the beer a nice fluffiness on the palate. This was my first time trying a Side Project sour and, although enjoyable, it definitely did not live up to my expectations. For $50, I would much rather splurge on some type of fruit-infused lambic of gueuze by Drie Fonteinen, which would likely be far more interesting and complex. Jan 10, 2025 Report",4.33

And when I say classic, it is an American classic as far as US stouts are concerned. Founders is a top 5 US brewery for me.  They offer this year round, but every year comes a new vintage with some minor differences here and there.  This is the 2023 vintage, bottled in June 2024.  That means this one was brewed back in 2023, probably in the late spring and then barreled for a year before bottling.  It's been in the bottle now for nearly 6 months.  A year and a half in the making.  Looking forward to it. At just below room temperature, a medium strength pour into a pint glass resulted in a 2-finger deep tan compacted head topping a very dark beer...I'll go ahead and call it black for sure.  Held it up to the light, and this one is black as black can be.  Looks absolutely terrific as usual for KBS. On the aroma, I get a blend of 60-70% cacao and dark roast to espresso roast coffee up front, with a good bit of oak barrel nearly right there with it.  Just a mild scent of bourbon there in the background.  A sense of sweetness in it.  I expected the aroma to be a bit more pronounced than I'm picking up but it smells very good nonetheless. The taste is terrific, with balanced flavors through the experience.  The backbone of this one is the balanced roasty, toasty dark chocolate and light espresso notes which I get upfront and then by mid-palate and the backend the booziness comes through with the oaky-bourbon introducing itself.  There's a bit of oaky vanilla there on the backend too, with a little bit of smokiness/pipe tobacco notes from the barrel coming through.  The flavors balance out very well on the backend and finish, with moderate, very pleasant bitterness.  The mouthfeel is on the upper side of light, which I didn't expect.  In previous years, it's had a minimum mid-medium mouthfeel to it.  Could be my palate today as well, as I've been sipping on several different RIS as of late.  But I tend to agree with myself that this one is on the lighter side compared to others I've had recently.  When I drink an imperial stout, especially one barrel aged, I want a heavier, creamier mouthfeel especially at 12%.  Although the feel is on the top side of light, the flavor experience is terrific, so I'm taking nothing away from that.  Let's go with a high end medium-bodied flavor experience.  Now this clocks in at 12% but it doesn't present itself like a 12%.  It's boozy for sure with the bourbon presence, but if I had to guess the ABV in a blind taste, I'd say it was around 7 to 8% max due mainly to the lighter mouthfeel.  The lacing layers wonderfully on the glass as I drink it, and with a good swirl, the head forms again nicely, indicative of a high quality brew. To rate my overall experience with this year's KBS, I'd say I'm very satisfied with it and will most likely buy this vintage again before the 2025 bottling period.  Something I've never done with KBS before is age it.  I might do that with a bottle or two and try it in a few years or so to see if the flavor profile changes.  Would be cool to get some dark fruit notes in there with that vanilla, oaky bourbon.  If you haven't had the 2024 bottle yet, it is worth a try for sure.   Cheers y'all! Dec 14, 2024 Report",4.33

The aroma is bold, with strong notes of oak, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. Some might find the sweetness a bit overbearing. The appearance is a dark, cloudy brown. On the palate, chocolate, oak, and booze harmoniously dominate the initial flavor, followed by layers of roasted malt and coffee. The finish leans heavily into coffee and booze.

Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Reviewed by JohnniEMc from Pennsylvania 3.91 /5 rDev -15% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75 This version came with a flat 14% ABV on the label. It came in a lovely 16.9 ounce brown bottle. The entire contents of which now temporarily reside inside a clear glass liter mug. The tan head, resulting from the pour, did not last. Of course, it's black coffee brown. There's plenty to smell, as the nose gets hit with alcohol, tannins and roasted malt, pretty close to that order. The taste is more complex. There's a bit of the coffee and dark chocolate references that come from this style. But, the alcohol and tannins still dominate and that's disappointing for someone that doesn't appreciate a stout tasting like a shot of bourbon, even in this case, good bourbon. This doesn't taste badly, just below expectations. This was bottled in 2021, so it has had a decent chance to age. Yet, it tastes like it hasn't. There's no anticipated melding of the flavors to create good nuances. Disappointing doesn't mean bad, at least in this case. Nor does it mean exceptional, as this one is not. Lastly, there's no glass lacing, but the body is good. Aug 02, 2024 Report",3.91
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Reviewed by ironprog from Florida 4.02 /5 rDev -12.6% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5 Note:  I am in the process of moving all of my ratings from other beer sites to here, so that all of my ratings are consolidated in one place.  The review below is an exact copy of my original RateBeer review from 10/16/2020. 1 pint .9 fl. Oz. Bottle. I have tried the last 3 years of vintage (2017, 2018, and 2019) and have rated each vintage separately as I tried them.  Although, with the exception of a few tasting notes and the alcohol content, I can't say that there has been much difference between the vintages.  This is (and apparently always will be) a big, boozy, beer that is extremely sweet.  I enjoy it immensely, but I do find that the syrupy sweetness becomes a little overpowering by the time I am finishing the beer.  Basically, it is liquid candy for adults!! 2019 Vintage (18AUG24) - 14.7% abv AROMA (9/10):   Big, boozy notes of soy sauce, vanilla, and alcohol with some slight smoke undertones. APPEARANCE (4/5): Pours an opaque black with a weak, dark tan, head that dissipates quickly.  Granted, I am drinking this almost 2 years after the bottled date, but given that the label says that it develops in the bottle up to 5 years, I would expect more body and life from the head.  Lacing is almost non-existent too. TASTE (7/10): Very sweet with huge flavors of dark fruit (e.g. raisins) and caramel, with just a hint of vanilla and smoke on the back end. MOUTHFEEL (4/5): Thick bodied with a creamy smooth texture.  Carbonation is average and the finish is medium and sweet. OVERALL (18/20): I really like this beer but it is almost too sweet for my tastes.  Even though the alcohol content is less, I am really not detecting any difference between this and the 2018 vintage.  I would prefer it if this one were less sweet and had more smokiness.  Or at least something to offset all that sweetness. 2018 Vintage (17SEP18) - 15.2% abv AROMA (9/10):   Big notes of soy sauce, vanilla, and alcohol with some slight smoke undertones. APPEARANCE (4/5): Pours an opaque black with a weak, dark tan, head that dissipates quickly. TASTE (7/10): Very sweet with flavors of dark fruit (e.g. raisins) and caramel, with just a hint of smoke on the back end. MOUTHFEEL (4/5): Thick bodied with a creamy smooth texture.  Carbonation is average and the finish is medium and sweet. OVERALL (18/20): I really like this beer but it is almost too sweet for my tastes.  Compared to the 2017 vintage, this one seems to have even less smoky flavor, and the 2017 didn't have much to begin with.  I would prefer it if this one were less sweet and had more smokiness. 2017 Vintage (04AUG17). AROMA (9/10):   Big notes of soy sauce, caramelized brown sugar, alcohol, and dark fruits (e.g. raisins). APPEARANCE (4/5): Pours an opaque black with a weak, dark tan, head that dissipates quickly. TASTE (7/10): Very sweet with flavors of dark fruit and caramel, with just a hint of smoke on the back end. PALATE (4/5): Thick bodied with a creamy smooth texture.  Carbonation is average and the finish is short and sweet. OVERALL (18/20): I really like this beer but it is almost too sweet for my tastes.  I would prefer it if it were a little less sweet and had just a pinch more smokiness.  But all in all, a fantastic beer.  I can’t wait to try the 2018 vintage to see how it compares!

Getting past the soy sauce and trying to imagine some sort of bourbonized liquid chocolate, this was actually enjoyable. It's smooth, thick and rich. It's like drinking liquid chocolate with whiskey in it, ok maybe not so much, but definitely has wine like qualities. At 14.1 percent ABV, this really packs a punch! But it's pretty mellow, not hot whatsoever. Flavor really sticks around. I can see this going well with smoked brisket that has a good bark. A very good sipper, excellent flavor profile between sips.

Drink by 29Jun27. Served cool into a brandy snifter. Appearance - Very dark brown from the bottle and virtually black in the glass. Thick and oily looking and a small half finger of deep tan head is poured and fizzles away into nothingness within a minute. Tiny little foamy collar left behind. Smell - A huge plethora of aromas come to the nose immediately. Leather, molasses, bourbon, treacle, burnt brown sugar, with some fudge-y chocolate backing that up. Dark fruits like prunes and figs are also there. Vanilla is present throughout but subdued. The big thing is the sheer number of aromas and how well they play together. Taste - Bitter and boozy upfront with vanilla accenting everything before there is some molasses that trhen transitions to sweet slightly toasted brown sugar. Back to bitterness with roasted malts, some dark chocolate and molasses mixture before finishing with a soft toffee. Leather gets mixed in with the earthiness too. The booze is present but well disguised for a 29 proof beer. It drinks and the intensity of the booze is pretty akin to most other 11-12.5% imperial stouts, so there is a smoothness. Taste kind of fades away eventually but after a couple of sips the booziness lingers reminding you of the strength. The depth and variety of flavor here is impressive. Mouthfeel - Thick and chewy, little prickles of carbonation try to shine through but really full bodied. Gentle warming heat in the back of the throat. Overall - Probably the best stout I've ever had the chance to enjoy, this lives up to the billing and the hype and I'm so stoked that I have a 2023 vintage to enjoy as well. Very much worth the price for a one off special occasion brew. Mar 13, 2024 Report",4.63

It has made many beers that I used to love take a much lower place on my want list. It is thick, black, savory, opulent, and above all incredibly flavorful. The poor is light on the head. I look at it as less waste to the heavens. I really feel that the thick, viscous strands of fluid on my glass are pulling the foam back into the glass. This allows me to enjoy more of it in my glass. The nose is sweet and rich. The initial taste grabs the tongue and lets you know something really good is coming.  The thick viscosity makes me feel it is worth the price.

Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Reviewed by nizzle8287 from Texas 4.02 /5 rDev -12.6% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4 Over-hyped much? Yes, I believe so... 2022 bottle poured into a snifter, as recommended, at around 50F. Almost no head, even upon pouring fairly hard, and it disappears into about a BB-sized patch that does percolate up from the bottom of the snifter... Black as a moonless night. Smell is bourbon, vanilla. Taste is bourbon, vanilla, a little cocoa, and a smidge of toffee, but the label says ""dried fruit"" which I fail to recognize. maybe it was the year of rest, or maybe it is the bourbon that overshadows all of the minor flavors... Overall very sweet and cloying. Perhaps this is where other drinkers give this brew all the credit: Mouthfeel. At 14.3% abv, you'd think this would be unbearable to drink, but it's actually not too bad. Far smoother than Tupps Full Grown Man, with less alcohol presence than one might imagine. Slightly sticky mouthfeel, however my tastes are developing into enjoying much dryer brews, so it just doesn't get the points from me like most others on here give it. Overall, I have one more 2022 bottle to drink, and I think I'll wait until 2025 to drink it, but I'm not itching to open another bottle of this. Wasn't too impressed, but I'm just not very impressed by cloyingly sweet bourbon anything, so don't take this too personally, but I won't buy this again. Jan 08, 2024 Report",4.02

Not as thick as it looks as far as feel, but very powerful stout all the same. Great cycle of flavors as you sip, ranging from dark cherry with a touch of subtle vanilla, to a roasted coffee, and always that sweet chocolatey presence behind it all that's so common in sweeter, American stouts. Little hint of licorice the further you go, and despite the big ABV, the booze presence is very tangled with that vanilla underbelly, never becoming a harsh, sharp thing, only ever working with the sweet, dark flavors. One of a kind experience, recommended wholeheartedly. Dec 29, 2023 Report",4.88

Now I must say, this is quite quite good. Like very good.  Somewhere between a good stout and an aged whiskey, which isn't a surprise based on the drink itself. That being said, it does not exemplify the thing I like most about beer so far being, drinkability. I do like the refreshing nature of a beer quite a bit and that is the only thing I'd say is absent here. At 14.3 percent, it's quite high for a beer, and you feel a lingering alcohol taste towards the end. It is accompanied by some sweet notes like date and chocolate though. Mouthfeel is very unique in that somehow the bubbles feel thick. Like the consistency is buttery and but the bubbles feel heavy for some reason bringing out a very odd and unique, but not off putting, almost soupy texture. Mouthfeel end notes are sticky and also a little velvety or caramel-like. Smell is a little sour and very malt forward, slightly fruity and even slightly-er herby. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend. I've been sipping as I write this and am appreciating it more and more. One hell of a beer. If you do grab one, the only thing I can say is that it's not smashable, but should be enjoyed slowly. Aug 28, 2023 Report",
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Reviewed by perfumer from Canada (BC) 4.86 /5 rDev +5.7% look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75 Finally getting to try this. 2022 vintage, poured from bottle into a snifter. Look: Black-brown-red, thick, oily. Very thin light brown head, no retention except a tiny ring. Smell: Oh wow. Damn, this is pulling no punches. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, malt, bourbon, dark bread, and the tiniest hints of vanilla beans, raisins, and bananas. Incredibly complex. Taste: YUUUUUP. Heavyweight, but incredibly smooth at the same time. Lots of the chocolate, with the vanilla bean and caramel notes playing second and third fiddle. Heavy maltiness and bourbon character, but still incredibly smooth with very little burn for the ABV. Raisin note is slightly present in the back, as well as the faintest banana peeking through once the malt onslaught begins to fade. Feel: Thick but only slightly oily on the palette, light but lingering carbonation. Sticks around a bit, but in a pleasant way and doesn't overstay its welcome. Very slightly syrupy. Really pleasant. Overall: Masterclass of an imperial stout. Has more distinct flavour impressions than most stouts with adjuncts, but is still perfectly balanced. Deserves the hype. May 19, 2023 Report",4.86

The smell is very reminiscent of whiskey due to the barrel aging. Slight alcohol tinge, but very fruity and sweet smelling. The smell is like raisins or figs. There is a slight fermentation flavor that reminds me of wine, likely due to the high ABV. The flavor is very sweet and low in bitterness. The flavor is extremely malty, and fruity. The taste seems like a cross between a high malt beer, a wine, and a bourbon. Notes of figs, raisins, trailed by syruppy molasses and fermentation flavors. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy.

It’s been quite some time since my last landmark review. My drinking has slowed in general and I’ve been mixing in cocktails more as well, but it’s always nice to keep a legendary beer around for a review like this. The Pinot Noir BA variant of Fermier was the best beer I’ve had from Side Project so far, so I’m excited to try this one. Let’s dive right in Pours a slightly cloudy orange gold with a finger of soapy white head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing The nose is funky but in a gentle way, if that makes any sense. I’m picking up on aromas of wet hay, apple cider vinegar, dry oak, lemon juice, earthy wheat, wildflower honey, white pepper, aged hops, tannic white wine, and stone It’s not as complex in taste unfortunately. It’s still a great beer but not what I was expecting. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting straw, lemon zest, wet hay, stone, pear skin, dry oak, white wine vinegar, earthy wheat, and light apricot. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, wildflower honey, earthy wheat, lemon verbena, apple skin, sharp oak, tannic white wine, stone, and peach pit A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out quickly Yeah this is a great beer and all, but it’s far from world class in my opinion. I just prefer a bit more funk in my Saisons Oct 14, 2024 Report",4.32

Mostly clear yellow pour with a fat finger of eggshell white foam, spotted lacing.  I went in skeptical here, but actually I must admit this is top shelf!  Smell capture a myriad of oak nuances catching fruit: peach, orange, lime, white grape, and green apple as the most defined, add a hint of dandelion and must to round out.  Taste takes it a step further: honestly SP's best non-fruit wild saison, if not their best saison period.  Add passion fruit, pear, and a whisper of grapefruit to the fruit from the nose, oak is now toasty and bright, vinous kiss adds layers in a gentle way, floral tones are more generic compared to nose though, must and funk elevate.  Feel is bright, sour, sneaky funky, oak backing is refined, and dries out well through the sip with controlled acidity dotting the palate, very dialed in. May 15, 2023 Report",4.68

This is absolutely outstanding stuff, perhaps the best wild ale that I've had from Side Project. It's immensely complex, with some light sweetness, almost candied dried fruit like, with lemon, lime, peach, grape must, a sort of leathery and grassy intense funk, and lots of wine barrel.

Vintage 2022 - 4/19/2025 Beautiful golden coloration, poured in a decanter and agitating fantastic fluffy white head that clings to the inside of the glass even at fridge temp. The nose is gorgeous - predominantly bright and floral, with musty undertones. Soft notes of meadowfoam honey, juniper, baked apples, and lemon zest. The palate is just as bright and inviting - distinctly dry, but with such complexity. Floral predominance, complimented by musty peach, bittering citrus rind, and apple.

The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is heavy of a raw and green hop smell with lots of grapefruit and pine hop smell mixed with herbal hop notes and some nice green grass smells.  Along with these smells comes a good showing of tropical fruits with notes of pineapple, guava, mango, and tangerine.  Other aromas of peach and nectarine and a bit of apricot.  Along with these smells comes aromas of pepper and spice, as well as some Taste – The taste begins with a mix of bready malt paired with the raw hop that was in the nose.  The hop is biggest of a raw and very green pine and herbal hop flavor, but is complimented by a little bit of grapefruit and notes of a floral hop.  The tropical fruits are not as big as I would have anticipated from the nose, playing an accessory role to the bready malt and some stone fruit flavors of peach and apricot.  As the taste advances, some grass and spice join in with the spice being of a white pepper and coriander flavor.  At the very end, the raw hop fades a touch, and a little bit of alcohol and wood join in, leaving one with a still very green and raw hopped, slightly malty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite thick and heavy with a carbonation level that is on the moderate to slightly lower side. For the big flavors and raw hopped nature the feel is good and makes for a slow and savorable sipper. Overall –A rather big and raw hopped up brew, with a big showing of malt and hop.  Big and bold.

An inch and a quarter of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far, falling in a little bit and become rocky looking. The aroma is pretty bright with notes of orange, berries, other tropical fruit, apple, hops resins, and pine. The taste keeps it going with additional notes of mango, honeydew melon, pssionfruit, and grapefruit. The malt is sweetish and bready, supporting the hop notes. A moderate bitterness and a fair amount of acidic ""hop bite"" balance it and it finishes dry with some fruit, resin, earth, and pine lingering. The head has held up really well and the lacing is fantastic. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gently crisp carbonation and a little zest from all of the hop acids, and then smooth towards the finish because of all the extra proteins.

Doubleganger,"Reviewed by farrago from New Jersey 4.33 /5 rDev -6.1% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25 Average pour fills two-thirds of a pint glass with deep tan foam, takes some time to settle down enough to take a sip, curiously not much stick to the lacing. The liquid basically looks like you took a glass of apricot juice and stuck in the freezer, impenetrable and immobile. The nose packs a solid punch of dank herbaceousness, roofing tar, pine sap and thick, sticky pineapple, mango, kiwi with some melon and peach in reserve, not teasing out any citrus nor florality. Full-bodied, without the help of the weakish carbonation manages nonetheless to develop nice momentum across the palate. In turn while it's juicy and ""damp"" at first there is a pleasing elevation in dryness at the end. Notes of brioche and challah bread pile on the mango, papaya, pineapple, kiwi fruit, intense fruit flavors. Vanilla ice cream touch pops up now and then. Still barely registering any citrus, pink grapefruit if anything. On the whole it tastes awfully like a confection dessert. Scores points for sheer bombast but I'd be hard pressed to see anyone easily put back two cans of it in a row, it's that tiring. (Canned 7/30/21) Aug 30, 2021 Report",4.33

While I've had Parabola before, this is my first time rating it, and as such I found myself paying more attention to it than normal.  The first thing that struck me was that as this poured out of the bottle, it had a surprising amber hue with almost Dr. Pepper vibes.  In the glass it's the super deep brown I expected, but with just a little bit of light coming in around the edges.  Not much in the way of head, but given the ABV and age this came as no surprise. The aroma doesn't burst from the glass, but up close it is wonderful.  Vanilla, milk chocolate and faint oak are all present, and combine to create a very nice smelling beer. Taste is much less sweet than the nose.  I'm greeted with strong roasted malts lending a nice bitterness that is well balanced by chocolate notes and faint  fig notes mid-palate.  Barrel and alcohol show up more on the finish. Overall, an excellent, no-frills beer. Mar 24, 2024 Report",

M - Sharp on the tongue, strong carbonation and moderate weight, closing clean enough to invite another drink. O - Nothing wrong with this brew.

I was thankful the bourbon still came through strong which did a lot for the taste. I think the most noticeable things about this beer are its ABV of 14.1% and it's ""weight"", both of which put it in the one-and-done category...and that's if you can finish the 12 oz bottle, which I was barely able to do after about 2 hours from the time I poured it.

The alcohol is well hidden and you can take big bites and chew on this beer. The alcohol settles to the bottom and although that's science, the flavors also sink there and are more pronounced in strength too, gives a different aspect of the beer. Including the smell.

I’m so hyped to try this so let’s just get into it Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing This beer relies heavily on the bourbon barrels in the nose, with most of the complexity coming from them. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy whiskey, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, dark cherry, toffee, smoky tobacco, plum, milk chocolate, and toasted coconut It is a bit less complex in taste, but I still think it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, dark chocolate, toasted oak, brown sugar, and sweet bourbon.

Here SP has done well to allowing the juicy peach tones shine too.  Smell is damn impressive: sour peach, yogurt, barnyard, and barrel funks, bright and rustic oak, pressed flowers, dry earth, a touch of lemon and lime zest, and finished with big hay. Taste is more sour and less complex with funk losing the barrel variety to the sour fruits, otherwise the same with sneaky complexity yet potent. Feel is sour and decently acidic, but gentle, dries out with various funks, almost feels more pungent than it tastes or smells. Clear yellow body with a pinky finger of white foam.

I’ve only had a few Side Project beers, but they’ve all been fantastic so I have no reason to think this one wouldn’t be. Let’s get into it Pours a cloudy pale gold with 2 fingers of whitehead that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing This is certainly tart in the nose, but it has a surprisingly nice balance to it. I'm picking up on aromas of tart peach, lemon yogurt, sharp oak, tannic white wine, straw, bready malt, wildflower honey, apple skin, light vinegar, stone, and even a touch of smoke In taste it starts off with a balanced tartness similar to the aroma, and on the back end explodes with an aggressive flash of tartness before settling down once again. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting jammy peach, lemon juice, vanilla, wet hay, straw, smooth oak, leather, and white grape. The swallow brings notes of tart peach, lemon juice, crabapple, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, wet hay, vanilla, bready malt, and light peat smoke A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a puckering beer.

Several ounces wasted and sedimentation disturbed from the bottom.  Color is apricot yellow/orange with a fizzy white head that dissipates almost instantaneously. Once that’s gone it actually looks flat.  It’s quite hazy, nearly opaque.  Certainly not much of a looker. S: Aroma is a great balance of fruit sweetness and tart sour characters. Huge fruit flesh characters with big peach as expected but also tangerine and apricot.  Lactic acidity and sour citrus to balance, I would say the tart/sour characters are moderate on the nose.  A bit of melting plastic like funk and mineral notes round it out. T: Taste is very delicious.  Much more sour than the nose, with huge puckering tartness.  Wonderful sweet fruit notes to balance, it’s very orange-family fruit forward with notes of oranges, tangerines, nectarines. Peace is primarily on the finish, but is quite nice.  Pretty big lemon tartness as well. Really fantastic. M/D: Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, carbonation is appropriately high even though it looks flat in the glass, drinkability is very good. O: Overall, this is an excellent beer, no doubt.  Although #37 overall rating on BA seems damn high.  Fair or not, I always compare these American Wild Ales to traditional Lambics, and even very well done ones such as this tend to lack the depth and complexities of most offerings from the likes of 3F and Cantillon.

Pours a moderately foggy sunglow orange, not dissimilar to the peach on the label. A thin, coarse, broken off-white head almost forms, before quickly falling, leaving only a razor-thin collar, and constant streams of effervescence. 4.25 Nose: Signature Side Project pale base, with evident crackery grains, a touch of malt, and some dusty silo. The peaches are restrained - apparent, but not loud, lending a very organic white peach aroma, much like nectarine. The acidity translates as fresh lemon juice, and just a splash of apple cider vinegar - tame, and bright.  There is a ton of wet white oak - woody and musty, playing with some funky wet hay, raw honey, stone cellar, dusty attic, leather, parchment, honeysuckle, lilac, dried leaves, and peach blossoms. Not aggressive funky or tart. Palate: Fuzzy greets the palate with a quick flash of tartness - lactic and acetic in nature, lending some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. The peaches, once more, are very natural and ripe, but not jammy. These are fruity, bright white peaches, with most of their fructose fermented out. Huge stone fruit notes of peach, nectarine, apricot, and a big plum presence. Remarkably floral, with honeysuckle, lilac, gardenia, and even a hint of honeydew melon. As the acidity curves, oak begins to show, along with a hint of sweet grain, which adds nice balance. Some farmhouse notes of hay, wet wet, stone, and earth emerge, providing that true wild touch, with the brett adding a nice dusty, sweaty, overripe element. It finishes remarkably clean, with a general stone fruit presence behind a fading acidity, some subtle grain, and drying wet white oak, with nothing really lingering. Mouthfeel/Body: It's incredible how Side Project can produce these 8% ABV wild ales with such clean, crisp, snappy fluidity. Fuzzy is light-bodied, with no real malt weight, and quite dry, with no significant residual sugars. Perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne, but with a similar feel - airy, clean, bright, and snappy. Acidity is tart - sour, even, but definitely shy of puckering. The finish has some nice drying tannic oak. Ultra-clean. Overall: Fuzzy is a bottle with a lofty reputation. Long considered one of the finest fruited wild ales. That's a tall order. Is it the greatest wild ale I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. Is it the greatest peach sour I've ever had? Most likely. What it most certainly is, is the definition of Side Project. Yes, it is one of the more sour offerings, using their high acid blonde base, but it isn't overbearing, and it's one of the more subtle offerings - beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that they're so great at. The tartness, the minerality, the organic nature of the fruit, the oak, the gentle funk, all meticulously blended. It really is a world-class wild ale, and one everyone should try at some point.

Snowed In - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by aleigator from Germany 4.16 /5 rDev -10.2% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4 Pours an almost entirely black color with a fluffy, big, dark brown head. Has a fantastic nose, full of roasted coconut, flowery, earthen coffee and a smack of toffee. Offers a hot chocolate quality with lots of melting cream in it, topped off by a slightly spicy, still floral barrel. Very convenient on the nose, with a prominent coconut-coffee interplay. Drinks creamy soft with a sparkly hint to it, lighter mouthfeel, malty sweet and complex, due to the well integrated barrel and the adjuncts. Tastes of toffee, earthy coffee with a roasted, dry hint to it, topped off by rock sugar. The barrel adds a warming note to the flavors, enhancing the already established coconut sweetness, together with a flowery note and a spicy bite. A prominent creaminess softens the barrel and brings out rock sugar even more, complimented by a wooden coffee dryness. Finishes with alcohol soaked pralines, fudge, maintaining coffee and a hint of toasty coconut, long and tasty. Pretty tasty and well composed, apart from its thinner mouthfeel. The barrel itself acts as a link for the different adjuncts, smoothing out the different flavors very well. Jan 31, 2017 Report",4.16

Snowed In - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by Stevedore from Oregon 4.4 /5 rDev -5% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 650ml bottle, 2016 release. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a dark chocolate brown body, mocha head comes up to about one finger, good retention, thin film, nice lacing. Smell is intense roasty coffee, more coffee, milk chocolate, touch of white chocolate, and bourbon sweetness. The coconut isn't really there. But the coffee is great. Flavour is more intense roasty coffee up front, transitioning into a milk chocolate, white chocolate sweetness followed by bourbon and a dash of coconut. That's pretty nice. It's all there for you to taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, smooth with a nice coconut and white chocolate sweetness on the backend. Another hit from Funky Buddha, I think I like this batch compared to last year's Snowed In. Jan 14, 2017 Report",

A: awesome cola like dark brown to black.  Pools into a viscous and luscious shape in small amounts. S: huge coconut with a lot of creamy vanilla and a solid chocolate aroma.  Smells like a delicious sweet treat of chocolate and coconut. T: Amazingl, the coconut and all that sweet aroma are present in the taste but not overpowering for what a great stout should be.  Extraordinary balance in the flavors.  The finishing taste presents some notes of coffee which was not as noticeable in the aroma until after tasting this delicious stout. M: Hard to find anything to dislike, this goes down so easily that this is truly a dangerous drink...  I might finish a keg alone tonight. O: A real favorite for me among stouts. I have had some really good stouts and this plays well with the best of them. It definitely is a bit sweeter than some of my other favorites but that is just a nice change and characteristic of a lot of things Funky Buddha produces. They really hit a home run with this one.

Vanilla, chocolate, nothing new...what a waste of my fucking time, on top of the fact that my finger's bleeding. It's a little sharp and hot, but the finish is thankfully not super sticky. That nougat and amaretto exhale though...okay, that's where it's at! --- And at DLD 2023, I return back to the place I first had a version of this beer, this time a 2022 vintage. it's perhaps better than I remember it, exhibiting more rich mocha wafer qualities this time. Maybe I was just too rip-roaring drunk to care to enjoy it the last time around, but even though my original description started out harsh, my rating wasn't, thus I'm not going to bump it up much further from my original 4.17.

Monster Tones,"Reviewed by Stevedore from Oregon 4.87 /5 rDev +3.2% look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5 2019 vintage. 650ml bottle, served in a snifter glass. Pours a dark black body, foreboding, thick and black. Oily, nice legs with a one finger mocha head, good retention, not much lacing. Again, fair bit of legs behind this one. Aroma is a massive, balanced and complex amalgamation of coconut, vanilla and light maple sweetness. It's pretty amazing how all this comes together. There's a big bourbon presence also, a bit warming and hot, buttressed by a big milk chocolate candy bar sweetness. A fair bit of roast coffee, oak, touch of whiskey smoke. Damn. The coconut and vanilla are massive, and I mean massive. It reminds me of the first time I had Vanilla Bean Dark Lord- except there is even more pastry coconut behind it. It takes that massive vanilla and bourbon, and adds coconut onto it. The coffee is almost an afterthought, but it does keep it from getting too sweet. The flavour follows the nose. I don't need to list any more superlatives, but it has a really nice balance to all of the adjuncts- mainly coconut and toasted marshmallows, with some maple sweetness, light coffee adding just a touch of roasty balance along with the big dark chocolate fudge. Incredible- there are stouts out there with the same adjuncts that fail to achieve that intense balance. If I had to quibble, and it's really a very small quibble, I thought it might be a little hotter than I'd like. The bourbon heat is strong here, but I think for most people, that's probably a selling point. Full bodied, fudgy and thick, substantial with appropriate carbonation- creamy, coating, and decadent. truly a liquid dessert, wonderful intensely aromatic and palate-coating adjunct flavours with a massive intensity that somehow all comes together as perfectly as one needs it to be. For me, the best beer I've had in some years. To me, this represents the next step in the evolution of barrel-aging, imperial stouts and adjuncts. Beers like Vanilla Bean Dark Lord, Kentucky Brunch, etc. pushed the envelope as far as it could, but this beer has taken the pastry stout to even dizzier heights. Apr 08, 2019 Report",4.87

Nose has a mix of deeper tropical notes (mango, mandarin orange) and some pinier, danker notes. There's a bit of menthol and diesel as well, so there's a good amount of balance here. Taste is dried grapefruit, dried orange peel, pineapple juice, but also some grain and even light booziness as it warms. Resinous and slick on the finish with a very soft mouthfeel, very little carbonation. Overall, this was certainly impressive, but it falls a little short of truly great for my taste.

Double Citra®,"Reviewed by JohnniEMc from Pennsylvania 4.71 /5 rDev +2.4% look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75 Served in a full clear pint glass, drawn from a tap, it arrived with a proper off-white head no more than a half-inch thick.  It's the color of a dark golden oak wood stain. It's hazy but not particularly dull. The aroma is hops and malt that somehow has a citrus reference, closest to grapefruit. That's just about how it tastes. There's just enough malt to add a good counterbalance, yet not make it too sweet, nor earthy. The hops bite, but not harshly, even during the finish. Yes, there is a citrusy aspect, but that's only a reference. It's actually more complex than that, as it's not just sharp like lemon or grapefruit. The alcohol is well integrated into the overall taste. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for the style, as witnessed by the lovely stratified glass lacing. OK, the tight head didn't make it to the finish, which didn't take long to complete. Really, there's nothing wrong with this beer. Sep 27, 2024 Report",4.71

Aroma is clean, vinous, and supremely ripe, highlighting a white wine contrast to waxy honey alongside a white tea florality; rustic funk is delicate as docile oak prickles the bouquet in tune with an increasingly focused white wine clarity. Taste presents a white wine-forward opening soon awash in clean minerals and gentle oak before a milky funk peaks over the mid-palate; spring pastures and a general earthiness  persists while a distant honey imbuement lingers over time. Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body and a steady ease of moderate carbonation, a taut texture finding transitional wetness while remaining resoundingly delicate on the tongue as the finish reveals a glossy, supremely tempered twang. An elegant, near dreamlike attenuation found at the apotheosis of the Hill blending program, delivering pastoral context thread through the deliberately silken gossamer of a gentler, American-styled saison; a level of reverence achieved through outright purity of form.

I really wanted to dislike this but it was indeed pretty sublime. By and large this is Anna, but the honey notes really come through here, with a diminished funk and acidity. Bit of leafy bitterness in the flavors, and definitely lots of white oak -- perhaps more than any beer I've had before.  Almost dusty. Main thing driving down the overall is the price and availability; while this is quite excellent, it is not the be-all and end-all of beer and instead falls in line with many of the other wine barrel aged HF offerings. Coincidentally, this is also the review that makes me a ""poo bah"" on this site. Feels like an appropriate occasion to be enjoying this 93/100 Jan 13, 2023 Report",4.61
Ann,"Reviewed by Sabtos from Ohio 4.52 /5 rDev -2.2% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 My long time white whale, we meet at last... As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening, we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions. The progression is beautifully subtle, while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark. Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna, with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body. This has closer to a honey appearance, whereas Anna is a hazier, paler yellow, with a larger, fluffier white head. The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than I was expecting, delivering a delicate experience that is less funky, yet more woody. White grape, riesling wine, and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry, falling off the palate quickly. There's a hint of green olive, and it's only mildly sour, with essentially no funkiness at all. This is possibly the most wine-like experience I've gotten out of a beer. So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare. It even sweetens up over time. Ann is absurdly refined and complex, yet exceedingly simple. It does not have the body of the other wonderful Farmstead beers, and while I love it, I think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is, as well as all the other HF shelfies, which are just so supple, easy to enjoy, and complex in their own right. Bottled 2015, released 2019. Thanks Stanley! --- Arriving on this fine autumn afternoon on Wednesday October 12th, 2022 after a leisurely hike at Long Pond behind Hill's property (the one you see in the aerial snaps), I wouldn't have dared to presume that the likes of Ann 2015 would be pouring from beautifully basket-nestled, honey-waxed bottles. I may have exhausted the remainder of good my luck for many years to come with this one. Pouring a finely hazy pale amber with a bubbly head dying to a thin ring, this vintage is unexpectedly oaky, particularly compared to my memory of 2019 Ann. It's got toasty, almost hickory qualities within the wood veins, while the acidity is very mild, like kumquat. The finish is bone dry, exhaling the same mild bleu funk found in the nose. When my partner mentions notions of pizza crust (and no, we haven't eaten yet today), I take that under consideration upon subsequent sips and actually detect characteristics of oregano and sundried tomato. While an unbelievable fortuitous experience, and a beautiful beer in its own right, this was not quite the stellar experience I was expecting. At the same time, I'd rate it right around the same as I did in 2019, so I'm not adjusting my score here. That said, I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I wish I had gotten a whack at Art this week. It's especially bittersweet to know that the next week's patrons actually did!

First half of pour was crystal clear golden body, second half was slightly hazy and a bit more orange. Good two finger white head that sticks around for a while. Aroma – I didn’t smell these all at once, I don’t even think that would be humanly possible, but noted them as it warmed and developed in the glass over a half hour or so. Honey. Lemongrass. Nectar. A delicate woodiness. Floral. Vanilla. Cedar. That musty, herbal smell when you walk into an old country store. Grassy. Hay. Pine cones. White wine. Potpourri. Fresh spring day frolicking through a meadow of hay. On the tongue it’s big but soft, delicate citrus and lemongrass, tart lactic and white wine, lightly funky with oak and a bit of mustiness. Honey comes through on the finish. Not overly dry but not sweet either. Lightly carbed with a very drinkable body. I’m glad I finally got to try this beer, it was quite the treat and worth the wait.

Aaron,"Reviewed by BEERchitect from Kentucky 4.4 /5 rDev -4.6% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Continuing to honor their family heritage, Hill Farmstead gives a tasty nod to their past publican and the strong British-styled ale to portray complexity, strength and charm. Rusty and hazy garnet, Aaron foregoes much of its froth in favor of a still, port-like appearance. As the sultry scent of chocolate, vinous spice and dark fruit fill the nose, the early taste is a molasses-wrapped sweetness akin to spice cake fruit cake and honey. That sweet tone settles onto the tastebuds while bold suggestions of prune and raisin flood the middle palate. A slow stewing of sweet malts invite a rich caramelization with toffee, coconut, vanilla, nuttiness, toasted oak and bourbon spice adding balance and intrigue. A modest bitterness arises as the session fades, and suggests a sweet earthiness of pipe tobacco, sun tea and fragrant woods. Full bodied, malt-dominant and finishing decidedly sweet, notions of port wine and sherry come to mind as the ale recedes into a warming bourbon taste with dark fruits in hand. Oct 31, 2024 Report",

Enjoyed this pour at Hill Farmstead in March 2024. The vintage was 2019, then aged two years in bourbon barrels. Copper colored liquid with the most minimal trace of bubbles around the glass. The nose brings out caramel, bourbon and oak, but the flavor...! Deep, deep flavor. Dark fruits--raisins, figs, dates with a mild woody backbone--I dare you not to close your eyes while sipping.

Years I've dreamed about this bottle. Years it has eluded me. Now, on my birthday evening, I'm staring face-to-face with Aaron - preparing to crack him open. I'm ready 2015 Vintage - Bottled May, 2017 - poured into a shifter at 45°F. Pours out with a glug, glug, glug, sitting a ruddy, rusty red-brown hue - cloudy, but does let some light in. A partial loose tan head bubbles, before quickly dissipating to a thin tan collar. 4.5 Nose: As soon as the cap came off, the aroma filled the room. English barleywine to a T. Sweet malt, raisins, toffee, brown sugar, caramel, Werther's Originals, leather, varnish, maple, cherry wood, pecan, maraschino cherries, candied dates, black grape, prune, and a kiss of molasses, all wrapped up into splintery white oak, with a beautiful bourbon presence, lending vanilla, and more caramel. A whisper of roast, some musty old rackhouse, and age. Time. Maturity. 4.5 Palate: Aaron greets the palate with a big sweet hug of toffee, caramel, date, dried fig, dried cherry, raisin, vanilla, plum, pecan, and maple. Rich, decadent, and bold, yet not cloying, as a second wave with oak, bourbon, and tons of dark fruit washes in and cuts into the sweetness. The dark fruit is very prominent, lending a subtle fruity tart kiss, which is crucial to providing balance. A round, malty nuttiness follows, with pecan, walnut, and that almost fatty element to them. The woody oak presence grows, and with it, some malted milk, vanilla creme, and just a dusting of cocoa, before the bourbon finally emerges, flowing into the finish - dry now, with splintery white oak and just a shadow of barrel char. Mouthfeel/Body: This is near-perfection. Aaron is rich, luscious, smooth, thick, and a bit viscous, yet avoids ever being syrupy, cloying, or overbearing. The oak and dark fruit brightness cut in just enough to thin it out, and the 9% ABV ensures it isn't pure glue, but worlds away from thin. Restrained, but respectable effervescence for the age, size, and style, and finishes with an incredible oaky dryness. Overall: Aaron is the number one rated English barleywine on BeerAdvocate, and for good reason - however, this goes beyond superficial ratings. Hill Farmstead instills magic in all of their hoppy and farmhouse ales, and Aaron is no exception. It's a beer with an identity, from a brewery with an identity. I'm not sure you could brew a better English barleywine if you tried. Yes, Aaron is hard to get, but if you can get him fairly, you'll be rewarded. Oct 21, 2020 Report",4.63

Bottled July 11th, 2018. The bottle says share…I’m not doing that. The pour is a dark red mixed with dark brown, with the overall impression being dark. The nose is unexpectedly light: bits of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, & half a rack of bourbon, which is the only thing that comes on strong. Maybe if I tell people my new kid is named Aaron, they’ll send me more of this. Because it’s pretty good. First off, it’s like being beaten about the tongue & gums with a wooden stave that’s brushed past a nice bourbon. Big, big wood with minor bourbon. The other main players are rich brown sugar, toffee, along with smoke-tinged maple & just a touch of booze. Exceedingly smooth & sweet. 500ML is the correct serving size for this baseball player. So glad I finally had the opportunity to try this. It didn’t lead up to the legendary hype, but it’s an excellent beer that deserves to be in the top echelon of barleywines. Sep 24, 2019 Report",4.13

Absolutely extraordinarily perfect high octane version of a English Barleywine. Had a beautiful if brief light tan head; excellent residual lacing. Rich tawny orange- ruby accented color. Like a beautiful piece teak. Both simple and then complex to light. Nose was rich with toffee/caramel; wood; vanilla; soft herbal flower and bitterness. Taste magnified all these and slowly revealed tannins; slight hints of licorice; apple; and allspice as it warmed. Sweetness but never candy or cloying. Traces of whiskey helped round out flavors but well in background. Feel was luxuriantly soft and smooth; very mildly dense like young port but never thick or distracting. Oh and $4 for 4oz glass????

I tried both the 2016 & 2018 batches. This was one of my biggest wants because I figured Hill Farmstead does everything else great, I bet they would nail a Barleywine as well. Oh, and it is barrel aged for like an eon. Aaron pours a dark brown. Not necessarily clear bodied behind the tint of the beer. A thin, defeated ring of diminutive bubbles rest steadily around the outer conversion of beer and glass; the only thing minute about this beer.  The aroma rises out of the glass like a slothful perfume. Thick, damp whiffs of bourbon, raisins, toffee, and dessert wine. Detailed, rich, royal. The flavor marches in line with the nose. Heavy, sweet, and decadent. I think the older batch has a bit more complexity but lacks the barrel character of it's newer kin. I get some flavors of boozy dates and maple syrup from both, though. Of course the feel stands abreast with the other elements of the beer. Portly, heavy, and warming. Toothsome but intense. Definitely lived up to the hype I personally gave this beer.

The recipe appears to be a cross of two of my favorite beers that Hill Farmstead has ever done - Vera Mae and Le Sarrasin - so this beer has been on my list for a while now. It's got this wonderfully fresh and lemony taste to it, like funky lemon candy, with that rustic funk - pear, citrus, grassy, a little bit of herbal and mineral character, along with lots of oak spice. There's also an outstanding sweet floral honey-like flavor. This is light bodied, effervescent, and very drinkable. Taking down an entire 750 of this one would be absolutely no problem.

This brewery is such a cool place to go—the food is fantastic, the grounds are friendly, and the service is top-notch. I am serving the beer at 46 degrees in a tulip glass. The pour created an airy, half-fingered, light pink head with fair retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The color is dark ruby red with a pinkish-red hue and is transparent with carbonation bubbles. This beer's appearance is elegant. Nosing the glass, I smelled tart, ripe raspberries, lightly toasted crackers, light funky barn, earthiness, light malty sweetness, floral esters, herbal, fruity sweetness, oak, and grassy. The first sip is bright, tart, juicy, ripe raspberries that you pick off the vine in the sunshine. Sipping the glass again, I notice yeast, crackers, lightly toasted malts, funky horse barn, earthiness, light malty sweetness, floral bouquet, oaky, and grassy. The mouthfeel is tart and acidic, and the finish is dry and crisp. The body is light and has high carbonation. Atrial Rubicite is one of the best examples of a wild ale with raspberries. The deft hands the brewers use to create this masterpiece are a marvel. The beer has yeasty notes, dryness, and bubbles like fine champagne. The raspberries used in this potion are at the peak of ripeness, giving the beer depth and freshness. The barrel aging is like the chef's kiss. A terrific beer! Apr 23, 2025 Report",4.77

This is Blend 13. Ranked #2 on BA in the wild Al style and#65 overall ….call me Ishmael …let this whale hunt begin The style according to BA is sometimes Belgian influenced, American Wild Ales are beers that are introduced to ""wild"" yeast or bacteria, such as Brettanomyces (Brettanomyces Bruxellensis, Brettanomyces Lambicus or Brettanomyces Anomalus), Pediococcus, or Lactobacillus. This introduction may occur from oak barrels that have been previously inoculated, pitching into the beer, or gained from various ""sour mash"" techniques. Regardless of the method, these yeast and/or bacteria leave a mark that should be noticeable to strong, and often contribute a sour and/or funky, wild note. Mixed-fermentation examples will display a range of aromatics, rather than a single dominant character. Brewers notes : Atrial Rubicite is made from well water, barley, wheat, hops, farmhouse yeast, native yeast from the Texas hill country, souring bacteria and raspberries. It’s 5.8% alcohol by volume, has a finishing gravity of 1.005 and is 3.36 pH. It is unfiltered, unpasteurized and 100% bottle conditioned. Atrial Rubicite is our first beer to be packaged exclusively in 500 ml bottles. Chilled bottle poured into a rinsed and dried Schilling teku glass. Deep ruby colored liquid crowned by a one finger pink froth.  Settles to a pencil thick layer The aroma?

Despite that, a constant longevity to the brim, providing a categorical aptness. In the interim, a trivial exposure on the collars cling, which substantially decreases through the periods. The appearance off the decant comes to a sangria to pansy purple dye, while highlighting pompadour to the carafe, as the vessel (on transfer) missions a bole tinge. On-top, an alabaster cap that brims to a link white per the aforementioned. The coloration presets get stretched on the discharge, as a way to represent a semi-transparent elegance S: An earthy introduction with a relaxed awareness on esters, as the microbial contagions adhere to the vintage. Confident components to the aged-oppressed raspberries through a matured involvedness, from a ripened oldness to an oxidative mephitis. Howbeit, a calculated fetor that’s initially repressed, as the draw comes with an hourly aridness. With this mind, the presetting notations reap the aggregates, of an array on drupelets ascribing raspberries. The symbolism stretches to a Clafoutis complexion, while remaining seedy and rooted to the additive. All the while, an implication to ethyl hexanoate, where the apple correspondences meld softly to the phenolic spin-offs. Such bonuses speak to the loitering spices found in eugenol, while complimenting the framework over the adjacent ketone (C10H12O2). At no cost, a wet – woodsy – hop effect that lends a resin kindness to the leafy tannins, aside the peppered herbaceous rearguards. The bacterial agents on lactobacillus are present to the caducity, while evolving a Camembert refinedness thru the employed (bottle) conditioning. Sequentially, a more captivating element on the native drivers, which offer a nuanced mustiness to cattle sheds, amid a smirched growth on Stinkhorns T: The virulence is perceptible on the cellared acidity, which comes with a well-bred dryness, for yeast explicitness. Nonetheless, a raspberry opulence to not be overtaken, yet an accessory that now parallels the implied draws on clingstone peaches & citron lemons. Markedly, an isoamyl octanoate nexus to the structure, which is supportive to the grains on rusticity. Assuaging hops provide a herbal kick to the eugenol compounds that touch on clove, when pitching resin to the concourse. The age welcomes a pastoral fondness with a vanilla oak consideration to the tannins on berries, as an acetate solvency crawls behind. A movement that expresses abandoned bunker silos, while airing farmland mildew on rabbity phenols. Moreover, an Alpaca wool note that corresponds to damp cattlehide, as a decanted nuttiness formulates aside moldy caverns. Oxidation comes sequentially with an elevated solvency on epoxy, while setting up Sangiovese commonalities. Correspondingly, a move in time that’s deftly degassed, as dry leather nears tobacco, when bordering burnt guaiacols M: An alleviated sweetness that’s pitted against acidic motorists, which is aeriated intentionally to strategically stabilize. There is a minerality factor that resembles an autumn jog with a soft mist, while tannins support an attenuated dry rider. In this situation, the approach inaugurates a bright vivacity that doesn’t pierce, but rather respects the framework, as a soft texture grows upon the weathered advancements O: The vintage has an acerbic presence that’s regulated thru wild yeast auras. Phenols that assist esters in an involved growth, while malts gently circulate a toasted granularity. Chiefly, one with an operative uniqueness to the raspberry add-ons, as a bacterial exsiccation maps out Dec 21, 2022 Report",4.38

Aroma is awash in fresh raspberry jam as silky vanillins underscore a gentle funk; wisps of Sangiovese impress an increasingly juicy red grape must, while oaky, lacto-funk evolves in turn over time. Taste brings raspberry jam cut with a level lacto-funk upfront; red Jolly Rancher is eased with subtle dry oak imparting red wine tannins and subtle minerality over the mid-palate and into the back end, where musty, wet basement undertones are interspersed along the finish. Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a subdued, moderate carbonation; a glossy lacto-cooling washes waves of funky brightness over the palate, while a tannic wetness lingers on the back end, drying quietly into the close. Jammy raspberry reverberates through a tannic silk and soft, funky underscore, leaving a wild ale perceptively hybridized by waves of dense fruit saturating rustic subtleties; a playfully approachable complexity throughout.

A small, flimsy, mocha colored film rose above the body, but it quickly broke into a thin, bubbly collar. Some spotty lacing trickled down the sides of the glass after the first few sips. The aroma was really bourbon-y and complex. Rich, robust, barrel notes came through big time. Roasted and caramel malt notes were apparent as well. Loads of caramel and brown sugar sweetness too. Fragrant vanilla notes were also quite prominent. Dark fruit notes also came through strong. Semisweet chocolate was noticeable too. Chocolate covered raisins came to mind. The flavor profile was also really intense and super bourbon forward but definitely a bit rough around the edges. There was a big caramel and roasted malt presence up front. Some brown sugar sweetness was noticeable as well. Boozy, bourbon barrel notes came through strong as the beer moved along the palate. Nice fragrant vanilla presence. Dark fruit notes were apparent here too. Savory raisin notes came to mind. More boozy bourbon barrel on the back end and the finish. Deeply roasted malt notes lingered after the swallow. The mouthfeel was exceptional. It was amazingly rich, dense and full bodied. Quite similar heavy whipping cream. The liquid contained a super fine and mellow effervescence that turned frothy and smooth on the palate. After a few sips, the sugars in the beer left a super sticky film on my lips.

Heavy oily legs cling to the glass after the lightest of swirls. It looks like motor oil that's been run hard through a motor for ten thousand miles - thick, dark, and viscous. Aroma pushes dark fruits, plum, and chocolate across the nose first. Char, barrel, bourbon, and hearty roasty and toasty malts sit behind. Dark fruits is the dominate note, at least, immediately out of the fridge. Mild brownie shows up as the beer warms. Flavor profile is dark fruits, caramel, toffee, tobacco, raisins, fig, plum, and chocolate. The blend of notes conjours up thoughts of barleywines, but retains heavy stout notes via late roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon, barrel, and char are all present to varying degrees, molding into the 14.6% ABV well. Brownie and more chocolate start to show up as the beer warms, masking some of hte initial dark fruit notes. It really develops a wonderful depth to the flavor profile after a fairly simplistic aroma. Mouth feel is thick and viscious, but with an otherwise flat and still effervescence. Overall, a blend of hearty stout and barleywine notes. It has a lot of dark fruits for a heavy stout, but despite that, retains a good balance despite being in wine alcohol territory.

The first consisting of base stout aged 22 months in Heaven Hill barrels, this comprises 80% of the blend. The remaining 20% is base stout aged 27 months on Weller barrels. We tasted through a couple dozen barrels to find a blend that best exemplifies our beloved barrel aged stout, Maman. Oak, maple, marshmallow, and caramel all dominate the aroma, with waves of rich brownie batter fudge and Heath bars wrap up the palate. We always strive for a balance of flavors in our beers, and we feel the nuance and surprising drinkability make this vintage of Maman something we’re immensely proud of. This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like high quality chocolate truffles, cookie dough, brownies, vanilla, spicy oak, caramelly bourbon, English toffee, marshmallow, heavy roast, and light smoke. This has been high on my list of ""must-tries"" for a long time, and it really did meet my expectations. It's a pure expression of the power of barrel - you could tell me this has chocolate or vanilla or caramel added to it, and I'd believe you. There's very little booze here, and there's great oaky complexity on the back end helping keep things balanced. There's some definite roast and bitterness - it's not just pure pastry here. This is medium bodied, not the thickest stout ever, but that honestly helps here - keeping it light on its feet and very drinkable. There's barely any booze to this. It's hard to find much to fault this one for. It's truly excellent - barrel aged chocolate marshmallow chunk brownies, essentially. Feb 22, 2021 Report",4.86

Bitterness is medium with mild fruity esters. M: The feel is a bit high in minerality for me with a little chalkiness in the finish. Body is medium  with low-medium carbonation.

If it didn't taste and smell so amazing, I'd wonder if they made beers just to look pretty on Instagram, but this matches on the other notes. I love that the ones from the Northeast do have a bit more of a bitter dry finish than the Midwestern ones that I drink most often (being from Chicago.) I DO wish they'd change to a 16oz can. There's a reason why that's so popular now as a format size, and with the dryer finish, I could really drink more than 12oz in a sitting. There's not as much on the nose as the super fresh Hop Butcher's that I most often drink, but that might be due to the can being a month old. I still get nice hops and bitter grapefruit rind on the nose and pallet. It's a wonderfully balanced beer. Will HF ever expand and increase distribution? If so, people will undoubtedly say their quality has dropped even if it doesn't. I'd love to see this in my area. Don't ever pass this one up! Oct 18, 2020 Report",4.69

Can stamped 02/24/20 Straw colored, turbid, with a pillowy white head that pushes damn near 3 fingers in height. Slowly recedes to a consistent, persistent finger high for the next 3-4 minutes. Some sticky lacing. Aroma bursts with an initial onslaught of zesty citrus: grapefruit, orange, lemon zest. But there's a honey-tinged grainy note too, akin to wet oats and buckwheat. I could smell this all day. Taste, again citrus forward but, more complex.m There's subtle hints of peach, cantaloupe, lemongrass, understated nods to onion and herbal spice that quickly retreat and leave a melange of crackery malt and a lingering grass-tinged bitterness. Mouthfeel is , well Hill Farmstead. I truly feel like the water is a key characteristic, their terroir. This one is a bit fluffy, and there is a mineral note that is divine. Carbonation is there throughout, but not prominent. Overall, the best example of a GALAXY focused DIPA or IPA I've ever tasted. One suggestion that would make this better, delivery to California.

A light citrus undertone carries through the palette and finish. A delicate crackery malt presence carries through and lingers long after the sip. Mouthfeel is on point. This beer is hazy, it is not turbid and it certainly doesn't feel chewy like many recent NEDIPAs.

Pours a thick murk. I'd say yellow, but it's a dark shade of yellow, almost brown. Oily head with a rainbow sheen. S - fruity peach, pineapple, and apricot. Herbal mango and hop esters. Tart lemon balances an incredible aroma. T - soft candied orange and tangerine. Subtly spicy with dank hop oils and vibrant passionfruit. Citrus rind a la grapefruit, orange, and lemon-lime, but almost no bitterness, just a mild tingle. Still manages to avoid total sweetness with a touch of dryness and overall herbal undertones. Gentle and balanced. F - mostly soft and fluffy with a hint of electric zest from the hop acidity. Full without being overly viscous. Low carbonation. O - one of Trillium's best. Not the juiciest or the most potent, but one of the most balanced. Soft, pithy flavors and focus on extracting as much flavor from the dry hopping as possible. Herbal without feeling like you're biting into raw hops and juicy without feeling like you're drinking Juicy Juice. Sep 11, 2019 Report",4.74

Clear gold body - head fizzes away very rapidly; no lacing; poor retention. Bright and balanced aromas of citrus, stone fruit, and gentle funk (buttermilk, hay-loft). Horse blanket on the palate entry, then a wave of acidity, giving way to a burst of nectarine at the apex of the sourness. Long fairly dry finish, suffused with fruit and offset by an oaky minerality and a low bitterness. Rich nectarine extraction wrings every bit of flavor available from the fruit with mature/restrained wild notes adding complexity to the clean/crackery malt base. Medium-light bodied, somewhat thin given the fleeting carbonation. Style guidelines aside (I do think this is more of a wild ale), this is an excellent beer, though not head and shoulders above the rest of the the brewer's (generally wonderful!) offerings.

Nectarine Premiere,"Reviewed by minterro from California 4.17 /5 rDev -9.5% look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25 Bottled 10/22 consumed 06/21/24. The cost for 750 mL was ~$20. A&S: Fizzy-looking tangerine-colored beer when initially poured. Its white head disappears immediately. The beer is so fizzy you can hear it. The beer undergoes a huge transformation in color when the sediment is poured in, it goes from bright tangerine to ruby orange-red. The aroma is moderately strong and pleasant, but pretty one-dimensional, stone fruits and citrus (nectarines and tangerines). As a side, the cork doesn't have much of an aroma. T&M Puckeringly tart off the bat. The same fruits as the aroma come out more in the second pour. It's super drinkable once it warms a bit and more of the sediment is poured in, but lacks a lot of funk I am accustomed to for this style. Some acidity but no real Brett character, no barn-yard, or oak. I did enjoy that it wasn't overly sweet. The mouthfeel is very fizzy, and spritz-like. Alcohol is very well hidden for being 8%, however, I also never felt like I got an 8% ABV buzz. Good effervesce. It was likely bottle-conditioned since it had more carbonation than I would expect after being aged in barrels for a year and in the bottle for 2 more years. Overall: Initially this beer was just above average, it opened up a little, and my rankings changed a bit, but overall I have to say I was disappointed. I thought the quality to price point was about right, but to be currently ranked #7 for Saisons, I just felt like it never came close to reaching that for me. It lacked the funk.

It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers, and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing Sheesh, less than stellar appearance aside, this is bold in the nose, just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine, wet hay, tart apricot, sharp oak, lemon yogurt, wildflower honey, straw, and crackery malt Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, stone, white wine vinegar, peach pit, nectarine, sharp oak, crackery malt, lemon yogurt, and light orange juice A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk Wow, this is one hell of a beer! It's highly complex, yet I could chug it. But why would I do that?

Nose is melon and unripe tropical fruits midway through without any agitation.  Giving the beer a swirl ripens the fruits pretty quickly, giving a sweeter impression overall (some sniffs expose an overripe burn, but it’s not the norm). When cold, the beer opens with an almost tart fruit note, which contrasts poorly with the more bitter middle and finish. It doesn’t completely disappear as the beer warms, but it does mellow out and blend in better.  The sweetness notes in the nose after a swirl pervades the opening through to near the finish, reducing the contrast, but taking the bitterness I enjoyed in the back end of a colder beer. This beer went from a disjointed start with highs and lows to a more balanced, but also more typical, very good hazy. Sep 08, 2023 Report",4.24

The taste follows the nose mainly in the same peachy citrus I first got from the nose. There’s also a nice grassiness that I didn’t pick up on in the nose along with the slightest touch of herbal green flowers.

A: Hazy glowing golden with 2-3 finger off-white, stick, frothy head with good retention and drapes of lacing.

Pineapple, passionfruit, lemongrass, ruby grapefruit, and tangerine come through strongest with more dank, herbal, grassy character in the finish.  Moderately bitter with fruity yeast esters.

Cara cara orange, tangerines, navel orange, peaches, powdered-sugar-dusted strawberries, mandarins, wafts of grapefruit, and sweet bready malt Taste: Jumps out of the gate with some raw, ripe, and lightly pithy citrus that includes pretty much every iteration of orange-related citrus; navel, cara cara, tangerines, kumquats, and mandarins, and these all quickly develop depth. Peaches and sweetened strawberries emerge when the citrus settles slightly and these all dance atop a nice malt base through the close, which flirts with having a bite Mouthfeel: Full, clean, smooth, medium-high carbonation, and smooth on the finish Overall: This is some really tasty stuff. The hype was big with me for this as I’ve heard of and about it 3 Floyd’s for almost 20 years but have never seen nor had anything from them until now and this lived up to it in my book. It’s a delicious and well-made APA that really showcases Citra hops nicely and blurs the APA/IPA line too but I wouldn’t say could be mistaken for an IPA as it lacks the bite and has a great malt backbone – something many IPAs don’t have, IMO. This reminds me of Georgetown’s Johnny Utah, another Citra Pale Ale, which is a compliment too as I love that beer. This is a winner and glad to have finally tried the elusive Zombie Dust.

T: Citrus, grapefruit, lemon, and orange, floral notes, tropical and stone fruit, mango, peach, apricot, pineapple, and a hint of melon, a bit resinous and grassy, slightly toasty bready malt, and a little caramel sweetness. M: A touch on the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation, somewhat soft on the palate. O: This is a beer that I wasn't sure I'd ever get to try, but I happened to find some on a trip to Las Vegas of all places. Not crazy fresh, but also not past my cutoff for hoppy beers, so I snapped it up, slammed it in my fridge, and cracked into it as soon as possible. This beer is an absolute time capsule back to that classic more malty Midwest style, just as the Citra train was getting rolling. Some will say that style is a bit outdated, and that at 6.5% it's basically an IPA. But who cares! It's smooth, balanced, and flavorful, and every little element is exceptionally well executed. It might not be what I'd reach for on a hot summer day, but once the sun went down it would hit the spot. Absolute classic of a pale ale and I'm stoked to finally cross it off my list.

Overall: I'd have said this was an IPA, if it wasn't listed as Pale Ale on the can (and here). It's slightly juicy, loaded with hops for a pale ale, doesn't have a big malt component in my humble opinion, and looks and tastes more like a hazy IPA. That said, it's tasty, and very drinkable.

APPEARANCE:  pours a cloudy, amber color with a beautiful two-finger, off-white head with excellent retention, the head eventually receded until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained throughout, medium carbonation and very heavy lacing on the glass, this is how beer is supposed to look. SMELL:  bread and pineapple citrus, very pleasant to the nose. TASTE:  the taste follows the nose, initially sweet pineapple citrus and then bread, the hops pleasantly lingered. PALATE:  this beer has average carbonation for the style but is creamy on the palate. OVERALL:  this is a terrific beer, it may be one of the best looking beers you can find, the taste is very pleasant but it's not especially complex, I see why this beer would be rated highly but it might be one of those beers that is overly hyped, having said that it's easily one of the best APA's I have had, I will definitely buy this again and would enthusiastically recommend to anyone who enjoys the style.

I have to say that any beer with a cartoon on the label doesn't fill me with anticipation. And I wasn't disappointed, as it was every bit as overrated as I expected after hearing all of the talk. The positive: it had a pleasant crispness that I would have expected from a pale ale. The negative: while not in grapefruit juice territory, it was way out-of-balance, far too hoppy to be able to drink a full can. I could smell the hops from several feet away. It's almost as though the over-hoppiness is some sort of virtue signaling for the craft beer crowd. Apr 20, 2024 Report",2.63

I poured a can (actually, many cans in total) into a pint glass.  There is a generous, light-beige head.  The beer is golden honey in color and slightly cloudy.  Small bubbles of carbonation rise from the bottom.  It smells quite hoppy, which I like. The taste is dominated by hops, with fairly thin and bland malt.  It has a strong grapefruit taste, as well, but I don't like the aftertaste, which is somewhat... FISHY, almost rancid.  So, it's not as malty as I would prefer, and it has an unpleasant aftertaste, adding up to being an average, maybe just a smidge above average beer.  Far below its reputation.

A gorgeous rich blonde color, the experience starts with the aroma. Oh sweet, heavily ambrosia. Real vanilla and custard on the top, followed by a ginger note, then braised pear. The bouquet continues with clove, all-spice and a dash of saffron, and finally a cooling aroma of oatmeal. The flavor definitely distinguishes this beer as a sour ale, but the balance between acidity and other flavors is masterful. A long saffron taste pairs with the sourness and is followed by a lemon zest aftertaste. Between sips my mouth warmths with the taste of shortbread, but that breaks with each sip as well, as muscat grape cleanses the palate to make way for each new round of the complex flavors.

Poured a nice haze and white head, which struggled to maintain. Decent lacing but dissipated way too quickly. Nose was present but fruits and pine were not explosive. A bit sedate. Flavor was orange forward; not much stone fruit/peach. Actually more dank than I had anticipated. Had expected some resin but more as an add-in to a sweeter/fruitier taste. Instead it was bitter more so than citrus sweet let alone peach. Body was not that smooth, and the decidedly brisk carbonation brightened the bitterness. Overall a nice hazy DIPA, but nothing you can’t get pretty easily elsewhere. Also, much more West Coast than I had expected. That’s not bad at all…but just not what I thought I’d heard. It was surprisingly MOR for a TH brew. It definitely was not “soft”; not particularly “well rounded”; pretty heavy hop load; but not at all the wonderfully typical TH “fluffiness”.

Poured into the snifter that was also courtesy of Roguer, this was an opaque, yellow-like color, with a good sized off-white head that was long lasting and left lots of lace. Massive, bitter, citrusy nose to this. Initially, quite bitter and astringent tasting, just a citric acid blast. As it warmed, balance crept in, with some sweet melon-like flavors offsetting the massive citrus fruit juice, along with something like a light touch of vanilla. Citrus flavor remained dominant, throughout, however. Finishes with a bitter dryness. Lightly creamy and yet dry mouth feel.

Mouthfeel is appropriately carbonated with a lingering bitter aftertaste that turns sweet as time progresses with some heat as it warms. This was a puzzler for my tastebuds.

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Reviewed by papposilenus from New Hampshire 4.13 /5 rDev -9.6% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4 From a 500ml bottle, dated 03/11/23. Served in a spiegelau tulip glass. Pours a thin-appearing oak-brown with no obvious highlights. A generous finger of lush, coffee colored foam doesn’t last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily, super-slippery lacing. Nose is… fruity? A sweet, candy-like coffee aroma and, totally unexpectedly, raspberry - which must be an olfactory hallucination, or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla, cinnamon and chiles. Taste is sweet but not heavily so, with a berry-like coffee bean flavour and that fruity mélange of cinnamon-vanilla-chile pepper that my brain persists in translating as ‘raspberry’ bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy.  A slick Cadbury-like milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles. There’s a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesn’t detract much. Feel is oily-smooth and creamy-slick, medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle, prickly carbonation. Chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation, lightening the mouthfeel further. Overall, pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag. I won’t call the flavours ‘muddled,’ but it is a very ‘busy’ flavour profile which, weirdly, for my palate, comes across very fruity and raspberry-like. Jun 14, 2023 Report",4.13

Flat black on the pour, thick, sticky, tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast. Smells like cinnamon, vanilla, cacao nibs, and chilli peppers being muddled together. Tastes the same. Just too much going on. Cloyingly sweet and thick, slightly gritty, too much cinnamon, and who needs hot peppers in their stout? Overall, I’ve attended 5 Hunahpu’s Day celebrations at the CCB Spruce Street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing: nice novelty.,. but way too busy and quite over rated.

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Reviewed by Roy_Hobbs from Connecticut 4.33 /5 rDev -5.3% look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 2020 vintage received courtesy of @roguer. Appearance is typical for the style, which means it's a nice looking dark, dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head.  Nice legs.  Aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent, but not in an artificial way.  Plenty of sweet molasses, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some faint figs / raisins.  That description doesn't do this any real justice, so in summary, this beer smells great. Taste is interesting. Nowhere near as sweet on the nose, with some naturally bitter cacao notes, cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer.   The spiciness is Goldilocks.....just right.  A bit less and they wouldn't be notable.  A bit more and they would overpower.  There's a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer.   Fully bodies and smooth, leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming. Overall this is excellent. Mar 04, 2023 Report",4.33

This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still Sep 02, 2022 Report",4.31

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Reviewed by SierraNevallagash from Maine 4.08 /5 rDev -10.7% look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.75 2018 Vintage 750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want! Pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75 Nose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25 Palate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0 Mouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25 Overall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.  3.75 Jul 09, 2021 Report",4.08

Fantastic smells; amburana and star anise; chili pepper notes; low-key dark chocolate tones in the background. The taste bursts with spicy and roasted grain flavors; cinnamon with slow-burn chili pepper flavors; nice blend of milk and bitter chocolate sweetness; slight sense of charred grain bitterness; mysterious dark pitted fruit esters. Heavy, silky mouthfeel; feels a tad weak for the style; slick residual sugars; balancing chili pepper heat. Compared to the 2020 version I had, this edition loses some points on looks and feel yet still retains a solid '5' taste rating and 4.5 overall score.

Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality. 2020 edition, 11.6% ABV per the Cigar City UPC sales sheet. This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what  treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department. This is one awesome imperial stout augmented with a devilish chili pepper kick. Apr 18, 2021 Report",4.53

Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. It pours almost jet black with a creamy, medium mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly.  Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon.  All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors.  It's so easy to drink.  The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% . Overall, Hunahpu's is everything I thought it would be - and more.  It's delicious and perfect either to pair with a hearty meal or for casual drinking.

Scent is citra goodness with intense notes of mango, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, a touch of pepper and a touch of dank.  Taste is simply fantastic -- a meaty explosion of orange, tangerine, mango, pineapple, and ending notes of grapefruit.  Feel is hefty, a bit spicy, and surprisingly crisp.

First - I asked the server for a west coast IPA, and Green is clearly not that - but that is comment on the server, not the beer. I also like New England IPAs. My reason for the negative review is the beer was very, I'll say harsh on the tongue. It overwhelmed any appreciation for the taste that I may have had. I don't know if they got the carbonation wrong in that batch or what, but I got a distinct (and unpleasant) tingling feeling on my tongue. I dunno - I see this beer is highly rated. I've had a similar sensation from other IPAs from time to time - perhaps a particular hop causes my tongue to react that way, or maybe it was the particular batch?

Classic frothy and rich forming fine tall four to three finger big head.  Small bubbles and cream white with a tellow like shine to the top and some island like retention.  Pale orange solid body, with a hint of shine and maybe some yellow hues. Creamy sensing aroma.  Mild touches of light herbs to pine and citrus oils with excellent hop forward presentation.  Creamy hinting vanilla, maybe even some biscuity malt notes which make for a real good bakery dessert like quality.  Quite nice nose here. Palate is really wonderful.  Big hinting touches of cream vanilla mixing with herbal sage and some big touches of green earth.  Supportive real rich malt backbone with an excellent young green hop angle but doesn't come out biting or painful.  The finish is the most impressive thing, chewy pastry like sweet malt mixing touches of icing sugar, with building mint that gets menthol like hot in the perfect building intensity.

""Green"" 16 fl. oz. can coded ""BLEED GREEN  #GOCELTICS  04/27/22  05:57:32"". Sampled on 05/14/22 $15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22 Notes via stream of consciousness: A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden/brass colored body. The head appears to be holding quite well. The aroma is fairly mild for an NEIPA but offers up passionfruit, nectarine, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of orange, pineapple, juicy apple, and distant lemon/lime.  The malt is basic, most likely with 2-row, wheat, and oats although I can't specifically taste the wheat or oats. A solid bitterness backs it and it finishes dry with some quickly passing fruit that leaves a soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue. It's fluffy and smooth with plenty of proteins. The head held up really well and it's left some very interesting to look at lace all around the glass. All in all I don't think that Green is Treehouse's best beer by any stretch but it's a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer. Review #7,968 May 14, 2022 Report",4.34

Off yellow with almost a hint of green this extra hazy ipa lives up to the name. The nose is the first indication that something is a miss here. Tropical fruits orange and peach shine through a subtle floral scent. We all drink beef for the taste and this one delivers. Again the citrus tropical lead the way and give way to a slight  bitter hop. A smooth mouthfeel makes this an easy drinker that can be enjoyed beyond its ABV. Apr 01, 2024 Report",4.48

It is an absolute masterclass in hop presentation. Soft and fruity aromatics, juxtaposed with bright and sharp bitterness. Full bodied and eminently drinkable. Really wonderful stuff. Bright and turbid liquid reminiscent of unpasteurized yellow grapefruir juice with a solid head of white foam Nice bright aromatics. Very much reminds me of candied citrus peels. Taste is a very nice balance of herbal bitterness that verges on mint along with a peachy berry note that is reminiscent of bubble gum in some way. Very nicely balanced.

""Haze"" 16 fl. oz. can coded ""BEER IS GOOD  05/03/22  06:26:37"". Sampled on 05/16/22 $17.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22 Notes via stream of consciousness: A two finger thick head of off-white rests atop a murky golden body with an orange sheen. The aroma isn't as strong as I expected but it delivers some orange and passionfruit over a sweetish and grainy malt base. The flavor is bright and vibrant with a clear note of tangerine backed by passionfruit, nectarine, apricot, and mango. The malt is delicately sweetish, bready, and lightly oat-like. The bitterness is moderate and yet it finishes dry due at least in part to some hop acidity. In the mouth it's medium bodied but it feels a little fuller due to all of the extra proteins giving it a fluffy feel. It's smooth but that hop burn gives it a little bit of an edge. The head has held up really well and I've still got a creamy, but more importanty complete, surface covering. The lacing covers quite a bit and looks like a drawing of trees out of a book of scary stories. The aroma is better on their ""Very Hazy"", and I've scored it better overall, but for my money I prefer this easier drinking version. Review #7,975 May 16, 2022 Report",4.37

An interesting aroma; like a sage / cucumber mix; faint bit of citrus. The taste follows along the lines of the smell; stronger sense of cucumber rind bitterness; biscuit-like malt flavor. Heavy body; moderate acidity; somewhat juicy, somewhat dry on the palate. All I can say is the smell and taste are weird. I don't recall tasting anything like this. If there is supposed to be a stronger citrus presence, it's missing in this sample. If anything, the hop profile seems like some weird combination of Motueka and Nelson Savin hops. Motueka has never thrilled me, but Nelson Savin can be very interesting. Still, there must be a reason it (currently) has a 100 score on BA, but I certainly don't understand it.

It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"". Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma. All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a  tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better. Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.

Pours a clear, yet ever-so-slightly foggy true gold hue, with all but a loose ring of white foam forming, that sticks around permanently. Some lazy effervescence is visible. Nose: In classic Hill Farmstead form, the aroma is beautifully delicate and fragile, beginning with subtle notes of malt and wheat, with a rustic sort of grainy note about it. Atop this, gentle acidity and beautiful minerality act as a conduit for a melange of bright vinous fruits in the form of lemon, pear, apple, nectarine, white grape, and gooseberry, and then this subtle, yet spectacular dark fruit note that is quietly jammy, sweet, and plummet, almost evoking a hint of grape juice and grape pixie stix. Finally, threads of oak, hay, grass, attic, leather, parchment, wet moss, and petrichor stitch it a together. Absolutely spectacular. Palate: Immediately, the defining notes of the base beer - Florence, are beautifully showcased here, rounded by maturity. She greets the palate with the most restrained acidity with a hint of lemon-lime, and then that unique floral, fresh coriander-eucalyptus note peaks through. Bright fresh fruity notes of pear, gooseberry, white wine grape, underripe plum, and tart plum skins all play together, surrounded by a racey, vibrant minerality that sparkles over the palate. There is a subtle thread of funk, lending damp earth, moss, hay, wet oak, white grape pomace, river stones, and a whisper if dusty brett, before the lemon-lime and exotic fruity floral notes resurface. A slight minty/camphoraceous element cools the palate, and then the oak comes in to dry out the fruity bits. Flora Plum finishes dry and clean, with a faint hint of grain, and zero acidity. Mouthfeel/Body: Delicate, light, and crisp, yet managing to avoid being watery or lacking in any way. Perfect gentle acidity, which is complimented by a zippy, sparkling minerality, and lively, but delicate effervescence. Perfectly dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness and plum-skin tartness. Subtle drying oak, and as clean as you could imagine. Overall: This is a truly spectacular farmhouse ale. I thought blueberry was divine, yet I believe this exceeds it - and I'm a sucker for blueberry. It's just so delicate, elegant, and tasteful, while truly conveying all the character of Florence, softened by oak and time, and delivering this subtle, but beautiful fruity plum influence. There's a reason this beer is so highly revered. Practically flawless, and utterly Hill Farmstead. Oct 04, 2020 Report",4.62

Look:  The first thing I notice is the beautiful color of this beer. It’s pours a translucent and slightly hazy appearance. The color matches what is describe as the pale, pinkish orange color on the inside of a plum.  If I had to name the color in would say “pink champagne.”  Bone white head that settles to a thin layer across the top, a thing ring of bubbles around the edge. One of the prettiest, and most uniquely colored beers I have ever seen. Smell:  Fruity, acidic, funky, all in unison. Peach and plum fruitiness with lemon and white vinegar acidity. The funk comes through as body odor and hint of plastic. Sweet, floral aromas. A touch powdery.  Some light berry notes including strawberry and raspberry. There is a dry, crackery, wheat-like component to the beer. The most complex aspect of this beer. Taste:  On the tip of the tongue some lemon zest and juicy plum sweetness. Then the tart acidity takes over. Tart, unripe plum, plum skin, lemon warhead. The beers dried out quickly. There is not really any funk coming through on the flavor profile. I assume the wine barrels used for this beer held white wine as opposed to red wine. Feel:  Low carbonation and very light on the palate. Very dry with tart acidity hitting the jowels. Overall:  A delicate and highly drinkable beer. It’s not the most intense or complex saison that I’ve had,  but it’s right up my alley with the fruit and acidity.  It’s a beautiful expression of plum. It has some funk on the nose, but the flavor profile relies exclusively on the fruit and acidity. Really excellent. Clean and crisp. Jun 16, 2019 Report",4.32

Look: Golden with a finger thick white head Aroma: sweet and tart fruit, wine and oak Taste: The flavor is sweet pears, green apple, lemon, wet oak, white grape, white wine, some delicious funk. It is tart and dry and complex but it is not too tart and dry. Body/Overall: light to medium body. Jan 18, 2020 Report",4.92
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Reviewed by GreesyFizeek from New York 4.74 /5 rDev +3.5% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75 2016 vintage. This one pours a slightly hazy dark orange color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like funky pear, orange rind, citrus, white wine, barnyard funk, oak, lemon peel, funky hay, and a slight acidic bite. As expected, this is pretty much awesome. It's deeply funky, with citrus, lemon, lime, white wine, dry spice, oak, and pear skin. It's not necessarily better than the regular Oude Gueuze, but it's certainly excellent. This is light bodied, clean, and not super sour, with a good drinkability. This is so deeply funky and complex, but it also somehow remains fairly approachable. This is really quite excellent, and basically a pinnacle of lambic beer. Nov 10, 2019 Report",4.74

The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is heaviest of an orange juice and tropical fruit smell of papaya, mango, and pineapple. Along with these smells is lots of guava and tangerine, along with some herbal hops and a nice showing of grapefruit and pine.  Other notes of a bready and doughy smell as well as some tropical fruit candy and some peach and apricot. Taste – The taste begins with a bready and doughy malt flavor paired with lots of the tropical flavors that were in the nose.  There is a big showing of papaya, guava, and tangerine, along with some pineapple and orange juice.  There is a bit of a pine and herbal hop upfront, with a decent showing of grapefruit.  As the taste advances the pine and herb get stronger, while the grapefruit fades a tad. Some peach and apricot, replace a bit of the tropical fruits, with some notes of earth and dirt joining in as well. There is a touch of pepper and spice, and a hint of booze and wood that come on at the end, leaving one with a rich and juicy taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite thick and chewy with a carbonation level that is slightly lower.  For the rich and big flavors of the brew, the feel is excellent, coating the tongue in all the big flavors of the brew. Overall – A quite nice hazy indeed. This ranks up there with the other big scorers for tree house and is certainly one to try. Jul 29, 2024 Report",

However, I have had Doubleganger, the extra hopped variant of this and enjoyed it quite a bit Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing There is a perfect blend of tropical fruit and dank herbal hops in the nose, quite unlike any beer of theirs or any IPA really, almost an earthy perfume vibe that oddly reminds me of the smell of a church. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, creamy peach, juicy papaya, pithy grapefruit, grassy hops, dank herbs, a bit of onion, and doughy malt to hold it all together Herbaceous vibes from the nose translate well into taste but with less intensity, allowing for greater balance which bumps up my rating. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy papaya, mango, overripe grapefruit, light pine, and a creamy malt. The swallow brings notes of herbal hops, creamy malt, tangerine, and underripe cantaloupe A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a very creamy beer that coats the mouth on the way down. Finishes somewhere between dry and slick This one was interesting for sure. Way more herbs than I usually get in a TH beer, and for uniqueness alone I have to bump up the overall score.

Appearance: Pours a dense, hazy golden-orange with a slight amber tint. The head is a fluffy white, about two fingers high, with great retention and thick lacing down the glass. Exactly what you expect from a NEIPA in terms of visual appeal—hazy, vibrant, and inviting. Aroma: Absolutely bursting with tropical fruit—mango, pineapple, guava, and sweet orange peel come through immediately. There’s a juicy citrus character layered with stone fruit and a subtle dank pine note underneath. The double dry hopping is evident—super fresh and saturated with hop aromatics. Taste: Juicy and fruit-forward on the palate with ripe mango, peach, tangerine, and melon. A light bready malt backbone supports the hops without getting in the way. There’s a touch of resinous bitterness near the finish that helps keep it from being cloying. Incredibly well-balanced for something so hop-saturated. Mouthfeel: Soft and creamy with a medium-full body. Moderate carbonation enhances the juiciness without making it overly prickly. Very smooth throughout—no harsh alcohol presence or astringency. Classic Trillium mouthfeel: plush and silky. Overall: Another standout from Trillium. Fort Point DDH is a showcase of hop expression—aromatic, juicy, and balanced with just enough bitterness to round it out. It’s easy-drinking but complex, and a prime example of what a double dry-hopped NEIPA should be. Trillium continues to set the bar in the hazy IPA world. Apr 20, 2025 Report",4.77

Pours out a dense milky pale whitish golden with a finger plus of creamy white head that fades to a small covering and rim. This is a good looking hazy, though to my sensibilities I always lean to clear beer - personal preference.... Aromatics burst from the glass with huge citrus, mango and tropical notes; some cantaloupe musk and a sweaty dankness with herbal green undertones. Taste is sweet with ripe pineapple, over ripe orange, grapefruit and a green dank and sweaty herbal flavour - moderate resinous bitterness that compliments the fruity flavours. Solid medium mouthfeel with very decent carbonation and a bittersweetness that sits briefly at the finish. Honestly not generally a hazy fan but this rivals Jade Dust from Pure Project as my all time favourite in the class (am I wrong - this is really an IPA, no?). May 09, 2024 Report",4.55

Smell...well, for starters I been catching whiffs of it for where I set it, arm's length away (and I have long arms). Smell is gorgeously tropical juicy, pineapple/mango/orange. Lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff. Taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. It's bitter up front, lots of resin, and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry / drying, slightly gritty.

Look: Pours a pale, but somehow full and hazy yellow with a large-pored white head that dissipates quickly without leaving any lacing. No floaters. Smell: Fresh citrus notes. Mainly lemon with hints of grapefruit. Taste: Yellow citrus fruits. Fresh and hoppy. Zesty and bitter body with a dry finish. Low sweetness. Feel: Very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch. Overall: Full and juicy Pale Ale with a strong focus on fresh citrus fruits. Could easily be mistaken for a DIPA. Very challenging compared to other Pale Ales with its full body and its dry finish. Great beer. Very intense. Feb 23, 2022 Report",4.49

Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Reviewed by ovaltine from Indiana 4.6 /5 rDev +0.7% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 I pop the top and take a gander. Golden color in the can, and there’s dank hop aromas wafting up to my schnoz. We are on the hop train, baby!!! A fairly aggressive pour reveals very hazy golden color beer with a sudsy bone white head. Gorgeous beer. Meanwhile, my schnoz is being assaulted by dank citrus aromas, primarily tangerine and grapefruit, with some juicy pineapple and a touch of berry. I’m guessing a Mosaic- and/or Citra-hopped IPA/DIPA of the NE-style. The taste is all about the dank - tangerine, touch of grapefruit, delicious pineapple, and more berry flavor than indicated by the nose, and a hint of pilsner malt. Most of all, this is JUICY. Very refreshing, too, but there’s a smidge of alcohol present, so I’m locking in on a DIPA that features the Mosaic hop. The mouthfeel is soft and very full, validating my belief this is a DIPA. And it is world-class, IMHO. Dec 15, 2020 Report",

Getting lots of tangerine/clementine and mango on the nose. The flavor is where this one took a weird turn for me - there was a strong vegetal flavor that overpowered everything for me through the mid and finish, kind of onion or garlic... or maybe some parsley (maybe that’s it because I’m not a big fan of parsley). Still really respectable, but not as tropical and fruity as I was expecting. Smooth finish, not too heavy or syrupy, with some lingering hoppy bitterness. This was can #1 of a 4 pack and has been stored cold the entire time, so I’ll definitely give it another shot and maybe see if it changes over time. Sadly, this one might just not be for me and not my fav DDH offering from Trillium. Nov 02, 2020 Report",3.88

Little to no carbonation streaming as it sits. Smell- Huge citrus (tangerine, grapefruit and lemon), tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, papaya and passion fruit), nectarine/peach, a bit of melon and berries, bready malt, little pine, some herbal/floral notes.

Pale orange and yellow, with a light custard thickness and excellent glow surprisingly.  Soft white forming three finger head that is soupy to light bubbles and mixing lacing. Excellent aromatic orange pineapple and exotic fruits.  Spiced hop angles coming with green spruce like tips of pine for excellent hop punch and balance between fruit and spice.  Fantastic nose, and controlled hinting sugar sweetness. Palate comes nicely but with an impressive package .  Fruity juices flavors but more of a classic pine and hop green bitter action that flavors more towards sage and earthy tones.  Finish comes with even a bitter melon like quality. Great take on a NEIPA that has more of a spicy kick but with a good sweet balance that isn't a sugar bomb, and a killer aroma. Jul 03, 2025 Report",4.56

T'was  close to a perfect pour, with slightly less than a half inch off-white head resting on top of a cloudy, yet fully colored apricot-amber liquid. Its head is tight and enduring. Its aroma keeps pace with the good things acoming, with a wonderful balance of malts and piney, yet citrus tinged hops. The taste, too, is in good balance, but not quite as full as the nose had promised. Everything thing expected, the sweet malting and mildly bittering hops are there, but it's not full tasting. However, what is there is very tasty. The mouthfeel is both pleasantly light and soft and smooth in its delivery. There's plenty of pretty stratified glass lacing left behind. This may be one of the most unnoticeable 8 % ABVs you'll ever drink. Overall, this is an exceptional modern American IPA. Perhaps it could be bolder, but this is a don't fix what's not broken situation. Jun 20, 2025 Report",4.37

The pour is mucky & murky, a New England retention pond after a heavy toxic rain. Plenty of contrasting white head that sticks around. Nose leads to white grapes mashed into a big old peach. Swish: The Legend, The NE IPA King, the standard murk merchant. It's the last creche I fall into. Taste mimes the nose: white grape, peach, mixed in with earthy hops, citrus, with a finishing sweep of sweetness cut by a vanishing sliver of bitterness. Thicker for an IPA but easy to drink (& not think about). Bissell's The Substance was one of my first experiences with a NE IPA (likely before they were called that) almost a decade ago & my opinion of them remains remarkably consistent: it's fine. Despite the towering reputation, this brew barely breaks from the pack of sweet, tropical, rather routine NE IPAs. Just fine. Jun 03, 2025 Report",

Was expecting a thick Shaq like body but it’s a more lean medium body, reminiscent of a Dwight Howard.

Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,"Reviewed by AmeriCanadian from Tennessee 4.44 /5 rDev -3.3% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 3-week-old can poured into a large stemless wine glass. Been anxious to try the DDH version of Ghost for a long time, as the OG is an all-timer for me.  Bought a 4-pack of cans so I'm excited to try this one at different ages and will update this review accordingly.  At 3 weeks I was a little worried that the DDH treatment wouldn't actually be additive, especially for a single-hopped beer where there's only so much goodness you can squeeze out of (albeit amazing) Citra.  And I think that's the case on this first can with the look and feel being identical (I hade the OG on tap the same night to provide a baseline), the aroma profile being a half-grade more enhanced, but the flavor profile being a half-grade lower due to the extra starchiness and green ""bite."" Quintessential hazy, juicy look with a nice head but perhaps a little less lacing than the OG.  Absolutely glowing and gorgeous. Near-perfect mix of dank, weedy, almost oniony (which I love) greens, bold orange, tangerine, citrus, and pithy grapefruit, a little underripe mango and overripe tropical fruit medley, pine resin, and clover honey.  It isn't as layered and nuanced as other worldclass, multi-hop hazies because the focus is wholly on Citra.  But if you're going to highlight a single hop there isn't a better choice, and this is an absolutely exceptional representation.  Fresh and bold with a lovely mineral note at the tail end. Taste is all of the above, with the tropical fruits taking a leading role.  Really a perfect amount of sweetness from the fruit juices, with wonderful pithiness and resiny bitterness as balance.  The aftertaste lingers beautifully with that same set of balanced notes.  The only negative is the increased starchy green note from the DDH treatment.  As the beer warms, that aspect decreases slightly.  And it certainly doesn't hurt the overall experience.  But it's harsher than the OG without anything additive on the tongue, at least compared to my first few years of drinking this beer.  (More recently I've found a similar note of semi-harsh bite bite to the OG, though that has often been in older bottles.  Not sure if this is a quality control issue or something else.) Wonderful coating and silky lusciousness without being chewy or heavy.  Outstanding. I think the OG (or at least the OG up until a year ago) is just a hair better, but I'm picking nits and am very interested to see what a few more weeks in the can does to the DDH version.

Has a somewhat grapefruit and tropical fruit scent, which I don't typically care for, but it's more pleasant to me than normal, because it's not overly pronounced. Taste - Taste is where I notice a difference to the regular one.  While I preferred the regular to the double dry hopped with Pliny the Elder vs Pliny for President (DDH), here I prefer the Double Dry Hopped.  I feel that here it moved away from the citrusy flavor towards the true hop goodness. Feel - Feel is identical to the regular - Good carbonation that feels good in the mouth. Overall - Overall, I'll give this a slight edge to the regular Ghost In The Machine. Jun 05, 2025 Report",4.56

Appearance:  super hazy, murky, medium yellow hue with a thick finger of frohty ivory foam atop.  Lookit ‘em clouds! Smell:  sweet malt with a nicely rich tropical-fruit character; passionfruit is mostly what I’m getting, maybe a little apricot too.  It’s rich, complex, and alluring. Taste:  there’s definitely sweetness here, but it is reasonably balanced with the hop flavors.  Again I get tropical passionfruit, maybe a little dankness, and just a hint of sharp citrus that frankly I could do without.  Not quite as enjoyable as the aroma for me, but this is still an excellent beer. Mouthfeel:  medium-rich body with a good carbonation and a rich, smooth creaminess.  I love it when an IPA can nail creaminess! Overall:  a totally solid hazy IPA.  Evidently I didn’t love it quite as much as the rest of BeerAdvocate, but this is still a damn good beer.

The beer poured an insanely cloudy, almost milky looking, straw yellow hue. A thin, frothy film topped the liquid, but it quickly dissolved. There was no lacing whatsoever. The aroma was fantastic. It was super dank and fruity. Tropical fruit notes came through strongest. Loads of tangy passionfruit and sweet mango. Ripe peach was also apparent. Bit of juicy citrus too. The dankness subsided pretty quickly but reappeared later. The flavor profile was also impressive, though more bitter and somewhat simpler than the nose. Citrus notes dominated. Nice mix of juicy orange flesh and bitter orange peel. Tangy tangerine notes were also apparent. Touch of lemony tartness in the center. Hint of passionfruit too. More citrus peel and rind-like bitterness on the back end and the finish. The mouthfeel was amazingly fluffy and soft. Medium-light bodied for the style. The beer contained a super fine and zippy effervescence that gave this beer and terrific suppleness on the palate. Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped Is an impressive beer and similar in many regards to some of the better offerings by Tree House, Trillium, etc. From what I can recall, this DDH version is better than the original, but I would need to do a side by side comparison to confirm this.

A DDH version sounds like it could make things even worse on that front, but this is a highly regarded beer so I had to order it when I saw it on Tavour. Let’s crack it open and see what it’s all about Pours a hazy milky yellow with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing The nose is aggressive here, but it’s aggressive in a great way that does not suggest hop burn. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, pineapple juice, orange juice, bready malt, grassy hops, dank weed, white pepper, and a touch of caramel And unfortunately this one also gets a bit too aggressive in taste, but I’m still enjoying it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting earthy hops, orange juice, dank weed, overripe cantaloupe, bready malt, white pepper, and light pine. The swallow brings notes of earthy hops, dank weed, orange juice, overripe cantaloupe, pithy grapefruit, bready malt, pine, pineapple juice, and an odd hint of gasoline A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and bitter because of the hops burn, but it eventually settles out I really wanted this one to be better than the original, but it’s really about the same. A bit less hop burn leads to a greater drinkability, but the odd gasoline note prevents me from bumping up the taste score May 22, 2023 Report",4.34

The aroma is incredibly inviting, with prominent notes of tropical fruit, citrus, and pine. The double dry-hopping process really shines through in the aroma, with a depth and complexity that is unmatched. On the palate, the beer is just as impressive. The first sip is bursting with juicy hop flavors, with mango, passionfruit, and grapefruit dominating the taste profile. The bitterness is well-balanced and not overpowering, allowing the fruity flavors to shine through. There is also a slight sweetness to the beer, likely from the malt bill, which provides a pleasant balance to the bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium body that coats the tongue and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. The carbonation is just right, providing a refreshing bite without being too fizzy. Overall, Parish Brewing Co.'s DDH Ghost in the Machine is an outstanding beer that deserves all the accolades it has received. It is a beautifully crafted IPA that is both complex and balanced, with a flavor profile that will please both hop-heads and beer novices alike. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch IPA experience. Apr 23, 2023 Report",

Oreo pie crusted vanilla bean creme brulee with a glass of red wine. Decadence and refinement collide.

Although that may be true, the brandy definitely adds a different character to the profile. The vanilla was quite potent, almost marshmallowy. The brandy notes complimented that nicely without being overly potent. It had a nice sense of balance. Other notes included molasses, chocolate, and tobacco.

Other than that, smell is sweet with candies, strawberries, marshmallow and bubble gum. Tons of marzipan also. Nice but a bit artificial (more than the bourbon vanilla, although this one varies a lot from one year to another...). No off-flavors like soy sauce or candy sugar however. T: Taste is awesome. The best Dark Lord I have had so far in this regard. Vanilla, marzipan, chocolate, dark fruits, prune, soaked plum and cherries mixed together. Deep and complex, balanced. Surprisingly not sweetness nor alcohol to be found on the palate. No artificial flavors either. I would say the taste is even better than the Pappy van Winkle version. Long lasting. Travels back and forth from vanilla to cherries, from chocolate to dark fruits. Subdued apple and brandy as it warms. Amazing! M: Awesome mouthfeel. The smoothest version of 2011 barrel aged dark lord. O: Awesome beer.

Lots of fun gents! From a 750 into a snifter 2011 vintage Bottle 403 of 433 APPEARANCE: Just like all the rest of them. Pours relatively clear for an imperial stout. Produces a small, one finger medium-looking head that quickly fades to a wisp and ring. Black body in the glass with some carbonation evident. Only a ring remains until the end and leaves no real lacing down the glass. A little too light a pour and an average head at best. SMELL: Much like the bourbon vanilla version, but slightly milder. A touch of brandy perhaps with a lightly roasted aroma, but this one is mostly vanilla on the nose and not overpowering. Milder and less artificial than the bourbon version. TASTE: Vanilla sweetness up front mostly, with sweet cream and a touch of brandy at the swallow. Some sweet Dark Lord after the swallow with molasses and caramel, but the vanilla and marshmellow flavor is more prevalent here. Bolder finish is sweet with enough vanilla and a touch of alcohol lingering on the palate. Milder and less arfitical than the bourbon vanilla version, much like the nose. PALATE: Slightly lighter than the base beer, but still big enough. Just like the other DL variants as well. Medium body with medium levels of carbonation. Creamy enough, goes down fine and finishes rather sticky on the palate. A bit of a burn and some heat lingers. OVERALL: Pretty good variant, and much better and less artificial than the bourbon vanilla version. The vanilla made this a little one-dimensional perhaps, but the small glass was certainly enjoyable. Finishing a bottle of this on my own would be a chore, however. Cheers for the fun tasting boys!

Opened alongside DL 10-12 and Bourbon Barrel DL 12 as part of our holiday StoutFest tasting. Pours an oily, thick blackness with a thin, filmy toasted brown head. Fades out completely leaving a few random spots of lacing dotted around the glass. Holy crap, this actually smells exactly like marshmallows. Heavy vanilla scents drizzled in chocolate and powered by some sweet brandy warmth. Layers of toasted dark malts and oak with hints of dark fruit and roasted nuts. It's like a booze-soaked s'more. Awesome - I literally couldn't stop smelling this. Intense brandy barrel flavor riddled with vanilla and marshmallow tones, serving as shockingly delicious exclamation points on the profile. Plenty of chocolate, sticky sweet malts and molasses. Touches of dark fruit and roasted oak. The vanilla beans and velvety brandy barrel character continue to tantalize the palate throughout the warm finish. Full, heavy body, sticky and creamy on the tongue. I was hoping this one really was going to live up to the ridiculous hype and it came through in spades. Utterly stunning and capable of completely elevating Dark Lord to heights the base beer can't even dream of reaching. This narrowly edged out Bourbon Barrel Dark Lord 12 as the best beer of the evening and is one of the best stouts I've had since Bourbon County Vanilla and Coffee. Nov 26, 2012 Report",4.84
Brandy Barrel Aged Dark Lord With Vanilla Beans,"Reviewed by jegross2 from Illinois 4.97 /5 rDev +7.1% look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5 Reviewing the Brandy Barrel Aged Dark Lord With Vanilla Beans from Three Floyds Brewing Company out of Munster, Indiana. This is one of the most sought after beers in the craft beer world, so I have to give a major thanks to Robbie Moy for cracking this one open and sharing it with me. This beer was only released once, and only to those who were lucky enough to have a winning scratch-off ticket at Dark Lord Day in 2011. This is the 2010 vintage of Dark Lord, aged for one year in brandy barrels with Madagascar vanilla beans added. Only 433 bottles of this were released. We cracked this one, in addition to several other big name goodies, to celebrate the end of the Illinois bar exam, my birthday, and Robbie Moy's birthday. Score: 99 Bottle number 332/433 (2011 vintage). Served in a wine chalice and enjoyed on 07/28/12. Review is from notes. Appearance: Jet black, with a thin brown highlight strip atop the glass when held up to light. A think layer of creamy melted milk chocolate colored head at pour settles to a pencil thin ring around the glass. The lacing is incredibly oily and it coats the side of the glass, slowly oozing back down. 4.5/5 Smell: Sweet vanilla, fudge, milk chocolate and a hint of alcohol heat. Then brandy and more fudge. Complex, balanced and chocolatey. Sweet on the nose, but not nearly as sweet as the base beer. Mild molasses in the nose too. 5/5 Taste: Sweet and creamy Edy's vanilla bean ice cream and brandy layered on top of molasses and fudgey milk chocolate. Decadent flavors coat the tongue in rich, lingering goodness. Molasses and raisin too. Definitely a sweet stout (but not cloying), though this one is a little less sweet than the 2011 bourbon vanilla dark lord was. There is a nice alcohol warmth to the finish without any real ""booziness"" that gives this one some ""life after death"" on the tongue. Mouthfeel: Full bodied, low carbonation. Viscous, sweet and ""sticky"" mouthfeel. 5/5 Overall: One of the best beers out there with a reputation for the same for a good reason. This beer is definitely one of the sweeter stouts out there, but it never crosses the line into the land of cloyingly sweet. I found the base beer and others like Lindley Park to be much sweeter. This is not a beer I could load up my cellar with at its retail price tag, even if I had the chance to buy multiples, and it's even harder to get through trade, but this is a must-try beer to hunt down and split with friends. Recommendation: Seek a bottle of this beer out. It is just as good as everyone says. Pairings: Vanilla custard. Cost: $50 for a 750 ml bottle. Sep 09, 2012 Report",4.97

So excited to be able to try this, and simultaneously did and did not live up to the hype.  Viscous black oil pour, no head save a thin brown ring.  Bourbon, coconut, peppers, cinnamon, to a lesser degree cardamom, bake into the chocolate and vanilla base with maple in the nose.  Taste does most the same but the bourbon and wood are thrown into the back seat, finishes chewy and drier.  This is where the hype conversation comes in.  Is it a great beer?  Yes.  Hype met, however is it better than other elite representations of this style? No, hype not met.  Seen most in the feel where it has great spice, smooth malts and gooey adjuncts textures, but the barrel is not super assertive, want more mass but love the dry chewy nature.

This is okay, but...I feel like I've been raped at this point, and not by the heat, but by the overwhelming hype people pumped this beer up to beer, only for it to be less enjoyable than numerous annual shelfies I can think of  right off the top of my head.

The can told me not to look at the beer, but I wanted to look at the beer. It looks the way a good beer looks in the mind's eye. Dense, lingering head, perfect yellow-gold color. Flawless, gorgeous, like an oil painting of itself. On the nose, oranges and pine resin. Tasting it, similar. Grapefruit, orange, resin. Juicy on the first notes, and then leaves a lingering taste of rind and pith. Very hoppy. Medium-bodied and smooth with sensible moderate carbonation. I like this better than Heady Topper, actually, which I also rated straight fives, months ago, from an objective standpoint. This time, the straight fives is personal- I REALLY like this beer.

Date on can: 07/01/2025 -- slightly under two weeks old. Drank from can, but I've seen photos of the pour. Looks excellent. Love the can artwork as well. Aroma is very dank, fresh cones with a hint of orange and earthiness. Solid roasted maltiness to round it out. This might be the most pure hop aroma I've smelled in a beer. It's almost like it's right off the vine. I am afraid this might be a little too pine forward for my taste though. Taste follows the nose well. Tons of fresh hops, very piney, floral and a bit dank. Hint of citrus in there as well, maybe some orange and grapefruit. Solid toasty maltiness to balance things out a bit, but it does finish decidedly bitter with pine and grapefruit rind. Was surprised to see this was a purely Mosaic/Citra hop profile, as I've had so many beers which utilize those hops and I find them quite boring now. But this has a completely different flavor profile, somehow. Solidly medium bodied with average carbonation and a lovely chewiness. Drinks easy enough but feels a bit hard on my stomach. Perhaps a bit too piney and bitter for my taste. This is quality stuff. Extremely fresh and pungent. Can't drink more than a few of these, though. I think I slightly prefer the Heady Topper, which is somehow easier to drink for me despite being higher ABV. This is definitely one to seek out for any IPA fans, though. A real treat. Cheers!

Pours with a hazy golden body that somehow reminds me of mango flesh. Bone white head, with great retention. Wicked can art. They really emphasized the drink from the can thing. I wonder how many consumers actually do that. The aroma is extremely vegetal in a savory way. Rich aromas of black pepper, cumin, oregano and coriander balance against a yeasty malt base with sharp spikes of pine, spruce and juniper in the middle and hints of tropical mango, passion fruit, papaya and orange coming through the spaces between. Sharp peppercorn and pine electrify the palate with each sip, somewhat overpowering the fruity hop character, but letting through a creamy nuttiness like toasted cashew. The finish is a kale smoothie with cumin and lime infused sourdough bread. I very much want to pair this with an Indian lentil curry. The mouthfeel is heavy and creamy with a moderately dry finish. Extremely unique. Desireable? If you're hungry, I think so. Nothing like most modern hazy IPAs. In the world of my dreams, there are a lot more beers like this. I think we fail to recognize that beer is really food, and that using it to get drunk is kinda not the point. The point is a shelf stable liquid that provides both hydration and nutrition and goes well with solid food.

Nice crispness from the grain bill and the amount of carbonation which I would describe as medium carbonation. There is a bit of peppery hop bitterness that lingers...washes out any malty sweetness or lack thereof. I want to say this is balanced with sweet/bitter due to the mouth tackiness/stickiness, but I'm have a hard time finding sweetness beneath the enormous hop profile. But that's not a terrible thing as my rating reflects. This is a well-crafted beer that the brewer makes work. Body is slightly on the full side of medium.

Oily black pour, no head.  Aromas of potent hazelnut, coffee, coconut and most of all dark chocolate meet the bourbon powerfully, slight marshmallow, vanillins, and malt in the background, wow.  Taste is still a diabetic nightmare, but the bourbon barrel does help balance more, thus less coconut and marshmallow, more dark oak, hazelnut, coffee, and an addition of caramel compared to the nose.  The feel just has so much residual sugar, making a shellac over any barrel depth, malts are smooth.  An opulent dessert of a stout, only in america Aug 09, 2024 Report",4.41

Pours pitch black, rich, and dense. Huge, dark mocha colored legs. No head, no lace. Nose is mocha, chocolate, hazelnut, and slight overtones of barrel. Just as advertised and amazingly rich. Beer opens rich milk chocolate, hazelnut, and mocha coffee. Layers of molasses, vanilla, and lactose in the middle. More chocolate, hazelnut, and pancake syrup in the back. The barrel character has mellowed out significantly at this point but the adjunct flavors are still bright as day. Somehow not overly sweet given the flavor combination. Long, lingering finish and aftertaste. Body is spot on. Rich, thick, and chewy. Coats the palate. Long, lingering, boozy aftertaste. This beer is impressive. Really nice balance in the flavor. I don't know that I want too much barrel so as to not drown out the other flavors here. Definitely worth trying. May 31, 2023 Report",4.57

Aroma is mostly hazelnut with some coffee and booze as well.  Thick, sticky, a woody smoothness and large amounts of hazelnut in this beer give it a nutty taste and slick feel as well.  Has a touch of lactic sweetness (assume the coconut making itself known) and there's a touch of coffee that allows the beer to be dry and maintain balance.  A dry, slightly boozy finish complements beer and it is an easy sipper to relax with. Dec 09, 2020 Report",4.03

Abricot Du Fermier,"Reviewed by SierraNevallagash from Maine 4.52 /5 rDev -1.3% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Batch 5 - 750ml bottle - Poured into a white wine stem at 40°F and allowed to warm up. Pours a deep, foggy, apricot orange, with absolutely zero head formation, and no sign of effervescence. A couple of tiny floaties can be seen, looking like pulp in fresh-squeezed orange juice. A few spots of lace cling to the glass, but otherwise, the ale is lifeless. Pretty colour though. Nose: That instantly recognisable Side Project base is instantly recognisable. A nice toasty grain backbone, tons of funky farmhouse wet hay bales, musty wet oak, tons of leather, dusty attic, musty stone cellar, mineralic rover stones, dried leaves, petrichor, mineral-rich white wine (Riesling, Pinot Gris), pitty fruit notes of cherry, plum, apricot, peach, etc.., wood shavings, magnolia blossoms, gardenia, lilac, honeysuckle, deep bretty funk, with some sweaty, horsey, stable notes, some lemon, lemon zest, and lemon oil acidity, and heaps of sweet, saturated stone fruit notes. This is seriously complex. Palate: AdF greets the palate with a blast of minerality and acidity. The acidity ia actually fairly tame, leaning more lacto than pedio, but it's compounded by this insane level of minerality. Sea shells, stone, aspirin, vitamin C - it almost lends a gooozie salinity. It all explodes at once, and it's hard to pull complexity out. Plenty of white oak, vinous cask notes (almost a Rosé), some farmy wet hay, dried grass, big fresh lemon and even some white grapefruit, tart pear, green apple, unripe gooseberry, underripe nectarine, peach, and lots of apricot, and strangely, some dark fruit shows up - overripe cherry, plum, and blackberry, which pair up with the stone fruit, and quickly dry out, seeing the acidity disappeared in the finish. This allows more oak, cereal grain, and some sweaty, musty brett to reemerge, turning back into musty wet wine cask - again, with this almost cherry note underneath it. The finish is bone dry, ultra clean, and lifts off nicely. Mouthfeel/Body: The body here is fantastic. Like most of these Side Project fruits, the ABV is at 8%, and it's right where it should be. Enough grain to lend some body and not be thin, but crisp enough to be a light-bodied ale, further lifted by that acidity and overall brightness. There's a bit of sweetness in here, but it eventually dries out completely. Effervescence is moderate. That is, it's a bit sparse, and not champagne-like. Spritzy, but neither fizzy nor lacking. Not puckering, but definitely sour. Overall: This is a beautiful beer. In a lot of ways, it's similar to Fuzzy. Fuzzy is a more complete beer. This has more flavour, more fruit, more acidity, but less oak, less character, but more flavour. If stone fruit sours are your jam, and you don't mind the bite, this is just a must try. Perhaps a bit more funk and complexity on the palate (like the nose) would improve this, but as-is, batch 5 is still delightful. Dec 11, 2020 Report",4.52
Abricot Du Fermier,"Reviewed by M-Fox24 from New Jersey 4.02 /5 rDev -12.2% look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4 A: An upbeat melon, carrot orange pour with mild yellow inserts. The collar is practical and comes slightly off-white with adequate retention S: The scent is energetic with rustic acidity, and upfront leggings in Riesling stone fruit: cherries, apricots, peaches, nectarines. The development is delayed from sharp acidity, but eventually picks up on the courtyard subtleties in oaked woodland, wheat orchards, cellared satchel, and peppered haystacks against the tempered/relaxed wine barrel T: More shaded barrel on taste peering alongside the wild horse blanket and funky greenwood. Tartness remains on crisp apricot, earthy pine needles, and honey fruit leather to skins of crunchy gold apple pears. There is a peppery, cutting sour bite throughout, but not crumbling to palate or too forceful/cut-throat with slight ventilation. Intensity varies and contracts in lapses, as involvedness constructs in temperature to warming cedar, mildewed pastures, white grape-vanilla jam, and softened fruit-nut bread M: Light, effervescent feel with medium carbonation and a prickly, peppery spice that ends parched O: A fair bit of workings coming out of a matured (2+ yrs.) Blend #3, where stability bobs thru piercing acidity: gravitates more sensibly over time to composure Sep 29, 2020 Report",4.02

The swallow brings notes of sweetened espresso, raisin, dark chocolate, dark toast, and chewy caramel A full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a creamy and chewy beer that needs some time to go down. Finishes mostly dry surprisingly with waves of sweet and roasty weaving in and out Another winner from TH. A bit heavy at times, especially up front, but once you get past that it's smooth sailing. I'd get it again along with some of the variants Apr 03, 2021 Report",4.22

West Ashley,"Reviewed by DefenCorps from Oregon 4.59 /5 rDev +0.7% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5 Most recent batch. Thanks, Sam! A clear light orange with a dense white head with excellent retention and lacing  this looks great. The nose is super ripe, fruity, floral apricots with a lactic saison adjacent base. Delicately floral fruit notes, probably from the Pinot Noir casks, is present, though this doesn't have a real red wine character. Vanilla to go with ripe apricots. Awesome. The fruit expression is sublime. The palate opens with a blend of lactic tartness, mildly yogurt like with lots of fresh apricots. Just tons of it, though in a nuanced, delicate way rather than the unabashed abandon that's Fou'Foune. No real funk here, this is fruit and acidity in perfect harmony. Vanillin, delicately fruity Pinot Noir, a nice tannin character are all present. Drying, lactic, fruity on the finish with lots of lingering apricots. Tannins and a little grain round out the finish. SARA beers aspire for a higher ideal in the mouthfeel category, and this beer delivers. Light, airy, parfait-like with tons of fine carbonation,  just enough to lift the fruit heavy beer but not so much that it's anywhere close to being foamy. Gentle,  coaxing, prodding,  this is a truly excellent beer. In contrast to the fresh Fantasia I had a couple of nights back- this has more fruit, more sourness but less funk and less depth outside the fruit. They are both equally good interpretations of the style, and I can see my preference flip flopping. Mar 29, 2021 Report",4.59

A very mellow orange taste is felt at the start but soon the strong peach taste in this one that will blow your mind, the tartness you would expect is minimal if any as the peaches are sweet enough to make your tastebuds focus on that.

Aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront, leaving crackery malt lingering into soft, grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time. Taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish. Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish. A warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins, an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean Hill IPA profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base.

It's quite resinous and bitter, with lots of pine and earthiness. There is a lot of juicy and citrusy type things, too, as I get grapefruit, melon, pineapple, and some lemon. There's not too much malt character, but it does finish a touch boozy. This is medium bodied, with an intense lingering bitterness, both from the hops and higher alchohol.

My other cache of Fremonts did not seem to hold up well into years 4 and 5, so I decided to solo dome this on a chilly 50s and 40s degree night. Pours a rich mahogany color with a nice penumbral head. The aroma is a mellow morning roast coffee with a waft of cinnamon behind it. Cinnamon is almost never a wanted adjunct for me, but considering this brew is #1 for style, I hazard a guess it will be done well, or at least the cinnamon profile will have subsided after two years. It is both done well and the cinnamon has mellowed to where it is a decent finish to the strong bourbon notes. The bourbon profile is complex, with essences of leather, slight prune notes, and that lighter oatmeal malt base. The coffee is almost imperceptible when you try to taste for it, but it creeps up in the linger like a morning blend sort of taste. Mouthfeel is full, with some hints of a bowl of steel cut oatmeal. The bourbon still gives a little bite, with a minor tannic dryness. Carbonation in a nucleated glass keeps it lively to drink. Quite good at two years, and had I another, it might hold up well into a third cellar year. Oct 10, 2024 Report",4.34

Received from @snaotheus in a ninja strike during BSBIF#1.  Reviewed 04/02/24 (Review 3240).  Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Printed on the bottom of the front label of the bomber “LIMITED 2021 RELEASE”.  Stored at 34 degrees at home.  Served at 55.0 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 60.2 degrees F. Appearance – 4 First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), slight haze. Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. Under direct light, same with tiny carbonation bubbles rising. When rear-lite, light penetrates at the bottom edge – ruby – and the top edge, citron. Head - Average (Maximum three cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density with a few rocks, fizzy, short retention, leaving a 0.2 crown and partial cap. Lacing – None, as expected at 13.5% ABV. Aroma – 3.25 – Chocolate and hints of bourbon.  No yeast, no hops, no malt, no spices, no alcohol (13.5 % ABV as marked on the label). Flavor – 3.5 – Begins bitter-sweet with chocolate and mild bourbon.  No yeast, no hops, no roasted malt. On the aftertaste, weak coffee, and cinnamon.  No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. No ethanol.  An uncomfortable gastric burn occurs. Palate – 3.5 – Medium; somewhat syrupy; soft but lively carbonation. Final impression and summation: 3.75 The label sets expectations high but the product fails to hit them.  The flavor is that of cheap caffe mocha with a bit of cinnamon and whiskey thrown in to make it interesting.  In general, unharmonious flavors are vying for attention.  Aroma isn’t bad, nor is appearance (any time the appearance is the high point, expect problems).  Overall, IMHO a missed target from a brewer that usually nails it. Feb 04, 2024 Report",3.52

A beer that lives up to the ratings and rankings. 2018 vintage, and if this has faded, I can only imagine how strong it is fresh. Pours dark, frothy creamy head and persistent lacing. Strong scents of cinnamon, coffee, and bourbon barrel over dark malt. Taste is very strong flavors of cinnamon, coffee, dark fruit, cocoa, and bourbon barrel. Damn, does this taste good. Medium bodied, mouth watering, a very barrel forward presence. This is just a goddamn great beer. Although I probably won’t let my second bottle get too much older, as this is in prime drinking time.

Appearance: Presents a very dark brown-hued body with a slim, scant ring of beige foam. Smell: Resounding, rich dark maltiness infused with cinnamon-vanilla infused sugar, (subtler) coffee, chocolate powder, German dark bread, dark syrup, dark fruits (all tings dark, really). Taste: Sweetish dark maltiness of toasted black bread, rounded roasted barley, scorched raw sugars with a mellow-minded earthy, woodsy quality from the spice and barrel. A pleasant, agreeable spiciness, particularly with the cinnamon without venturing into heavy-handed crap-can Red Hot candy territory. Dark fruitiness a little raisiny. Touches of vanilla creme, Dutch stroop. Subtle coffee infusion. Good amount of barrel character, it's certainly warming though never heated or hot. Continued traces of fruit and spice on the silken finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Low carbonation. Smooth, supple mouthfeel. Overall: Enjoyable. Feb 09, 2023 Report",

Poured from a waxed 22oz bomber into a snifter. Clear bistre kissed seal brown liquid topped by a lasting event-horizon of desert sand. Thick, fine lacing; shimmering sticky panes of tears; excellent retention. Champurrado, cocoa, cinnamon, and earthy coffee with a hints of kretek in the nose. Very mild. Intense palate entry, heavy/sharp sweetness with waves of blackstrap, coffee, walnuts, black currant, and fig. Moderate earthy bitterness washed away by the alcohol (hints of rum and irish whiskey, and port more than bourbon) and spice notes in the long medium finish. Low tartness with hints of oak comes and goes. Rich, creamy, medium-full bodied, with low astringency and good round carbonation. A tiny bit hot perhaps. An interesting base beer not overwhelmed by adjuncts, though quite coffee-forward at the moment. Jan 01, 2023 Report",4.39

Especially after having The Rusty Nail and knowing they excel at using cinnamon as an adjunct, I can’t wait to try this. Let’s get into it Pours a very dark brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing This is super cinnamon forward in the nose, almost too much but it’s still nice. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, spicy whiskey, and toasted oak It’s a bit more balanced in taste, and very good, but I was expecting this to pop more. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, toasted oak, earthy cinnamon, raisin, earthy whiskey, brown sugar, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, sweetened coffee, milk chocolate, toasted oak, caramel, and bourbon. Gets better as it warms but I wanted more complexity out if it A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a lush yet zippy beer. Finishes dry for everything going on and drinks well below the 13% listed Given the fact that it improves over the course of drinking it, I have to bump this one up a bit in the overall. Still not everything I was hoping for but very good Apr 30, 2022 Report",4.31

My second version of B-bomb, but I haven't had the base beer yet. This is well rounded and wonderfully balanced overall. The barrel presence is magnificent, no surprise from Fremont, rich with bourbon and mellow vanilla with hints of oaky leather. I want my funeral pyre built with spent staves from Fremont barrels. Under all that was creamy cocoa, dates and raisins, caramel, subtle coffee, and dessert like cinnamon. This is wonderful as is, but I hope I get to try a fresh bottle someday with more assertive coffee notes. Now having 2018, aged and purchased under the same circumstances. This version was a few bucks cheaper for some reason. This was drier and a bit roastier. Less cinnamon and surprisingly more coffee maybe. Just a bit less decadent than the 2019. Edit 4/1/22 got my wish, now enjoying a fresh 2022 bottle. The coffee is more assertive but so is the cinnamon. I'm also getting a strong coconut note. Huge barrel presence but the figs , cocoa, and raisins are subdued. It's wonderful now, but I think I'll age the other for a year or so. Oct 09, 2021 Report",4.68

Fades after a minute or so, leaves a nice ring of foam around the edge when it does S: nice and inviting nose, full without coming across heavy or sweet. Great chocolate aroma to open, solid roast coffee comes through as well. There’s a bit of cinnamon spice coming through as well, adds some nice complexity but doesn’t become a dominant note. A bit more cinnamon as it’s warmed, along with a small bit of abv heat T: follows the nose well, a great dark chocolate note with dark roast coffee notes shining as well. That cinnamon comes through to add some nice depth, but again more playing a supporting role than really acting as a main flavor. This was as it was cold from the fridge - as it’s warmed that cinnamon comes through more, still not aggressive but a nice addition to the chocolate. Medium-long finish, with a nice bitter coffee/dark chocolate coming through. Abv works very well, provides that warming character without coming across hot F: medium body, medium carbonation, would have liked it a bit thicker but not sure if that’s me thinking stout vs. winter warmer (what is the appropriate body for the style?) O: a really nice winter warmer (not that I’ve had many in the style).

Can taste a bit of a booze burn when it warms but the balance on this is good enough that I'm not kicking myself for not aging this longer; at least not too much.

The head slowly dropped to a thick, lasting collar. Spotty lacing trickled down the sides of the glass. The aroma was outstanding and very closely resembled a traditional Belgian gueuze. With the head in tact, crisp, dry, powdery yeast notes dominated. After the head receded, the nose turned tart and funky with loads of must and horse blanket. Bright lemon, white pepper and a dusty, oaky-ness also came through strong. There was a nice subtle sweet-tart quality that reminded me of actual SweetTarts. A Chardonnay-like note was also detectable. Some earthy hops appeared as the liquid warmed. The flavor profile was somewhat similar to the aroma but more bitter and not quite as complex. Super lemony and tart up front. Uber crisp and dry. Spicy, peppery notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate. Musty, funky notes came through in the center. Lemon peel was also noticeable here. Some wheatiness too. Big earthy hop presence on the back end. The hops really intensified in dry, bitter finish. As the liquid sat, the bitterness crescendoed. The mouthfeel was outstanding. Lighter bodied and highly effervescent. The liquid contained a larger bubbled, rather aggressive carbonation that was very similar to a traditional Belgian gueuze or an aged Champagne. American wild ales rarely approach the complexity of traditional Belgian gueuzes and lambics, but de Garde’s The Broken Truck is a rare exception. The must, funk and overall complexity of this beer was exceptional, and the tartness and acidity were both kept to a moderate level. My only knock against this was that the hops were a bit aggressive. Nov 02, 2024 Report",4.72

Whooo boy, some good'uns.  This is the '22 bottle. Pours yellow out on the river.  Summer winding down, let's finish it up.  Hits some amazing funky sour spontaneous notes.  And they said it couldn't be done on this side of the pond.  Just a delight to smell.  The best of what Tilamook has to offer.  Boasts fresh french oak feels, bugs, grapefruit, lemon rind, bleu cheese, green apple yogurt.  The gang's all here. The taste was such a nice thing, great bottle on one of those awesome yet sad close to summer beers.  Made it memorable.  Its vibrant, fresh cut hay and oak alongside some citrus wedges like you just stomped some kids at youth soccer.  One of the best expressions of brett ever in a beer.  Sawft body too, never felt too acidic or sour.  This is honestly  better than most Belgian gueuzes.  I realize given the demographics of beer nerds, they're going to keep fetishizing Western Europe, but I'll be more than happy to take any of these Wisconsin and Oregon gems off your hands.

The Broken Truck,"Reviewed by WickedBeer from Alabama 4.29 /5 rDev -6.3% look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Opened up No. 6 (1/20), 7 (1/21), and 8 (1/22) together and tasted side-by-side. All three boasted a beautiful golden yellow on the pour, with frothy, aromatic head that was slow to settle into the body of the beer. No.6 brought notes of lemon zest, oak, and white grape must on a sweet, musty backbone. No. 7 came on sweeter, with more of a citrus candy quality and a bit less Brett character. The oak component had more of a ""freshly cut"" aroma to it, and preceded notes of bleu cheese that I didn't get on No.6. No.8 was probably the most distinctly unique; white wine like with 7, but more of a grapefruit-specific citrus quality and a deeper complexity of wet hay and an overall better balance of sweet & funky. The palate on all three of these were led predominantly with drying tannin and bitter citrus peel. The oakiness was relatively similar amongst the three and bolstered the flavor influence from the yeast bill, however while No.8 showed its youth with the least amount of bitterness, 7 & 8 had comparable dryness and a more noticeable citrusy bitterness. No. 6 was also had the highest level of residual puckering tartness. Light-bodied, dry, and lightly bitter mouthfeel to all three. As mentioned, varying levels of tartness / acid, but all very soft in their carbonation and smooth in the finish. Overall, I'm honestly surprised with how similar each vintage of these beers was. Each had their own unique nuances, but when broken down you could find very similar characteristics on both the nose and the palate with both, characterizing a predominance of fresh oak, Brett, bitter citrus, drying tannin, and a noticeable albeit subtle funky/cheesy quality on the backbone. Definitely fun to have these all side-by-side. Nov 06, 2022 Report",4.29

A clear copper with a dense, white head with good retention and minimal lacing, this looks solid. The nose is pretty excellent. Insanely funky with preserved lemon, earth, mushroom, petrichor, light honey, floral orange blossoms, grapefruit pith. The dry, dusty, mineraly funk is just awesome. Dried mushroom for days. Delicate elderflower funk notes are present. The palate opens tart and lactic, a blend of earthy and mushroomy funk, complementing the sourness quite well. The sourness is reserved, not only for the style, but also given the age and the fact that this is an older de Garde. Remarkably well balanced, there are undercurrents of peach and pear. The funk on the palate is just fantastic, with layers of earth, leather, mushroom, cobwebs and must, and yes, some horseblanket as well. Drying, tart on the finish with a moderate carbonation, flavors of earth and mushroom linger. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the funk. Truly old world like. **Edit July 9, 2023** Blend 9, bottled 12/22 Soft, ripe,  fruity funk,  earthy,  delicate,  lightly acidic with a gentle, brooding, musty oak character.

(You wouldn't think so since I've reviewed over 80 on BA.)  I've also spent most of this summer in Sonoma County. So in good conscience,  I really could no longer avoid BA's most rated Wilds, Supplication and Consecration. Supplication Looks like many a Wild; not much foam, but an interesting red-brown colour. Smells indicate the masters are at work: the Brett/funk is controlled here (hard to do.) Tastes are tart, but moderated either by the long-aging or some other process above my pay scale.  Supplication probably  too dry for my palate and many foods. But I will try this with a soft cheese, maybe a stinky one also. Medium-mouthed moving into full fast. Excellent Overall Hugs for RRBC for capturing Sonoma's terroir and bottling it. Funny story. I'm sitting on the porch overlooking the vineyards with my grape-growing friend. We're talking about Sonoma's terroir. She's drinking a dry wine and I'm drinking Supplication.

Reviewed 23/06/23 (Review 3127). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Label stamped “BOTTLED ON 020823”.  Stored at 34 degrees at home.  Served at 49.8 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 55.9 degrees F. Appearance – 4.25 First pour – Gold (SRM 5), clear. Body – Deep Gold (SRM 6), chill haze. Under direct light, opaque. When rear lite, chill haze. Head: Average (Maximum 3.5 cm, aggressive center pour), champagne, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.5 mm broken ring of bubbles with no cap. Lacing – None. Aroma – 4.5 – Weak cherries and oak.  No yeast, no hops.  No ethanol (7.75 % ABV according to the label). Flavor – 4.5 – Cherry, slightly sour with some tannin.  No yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.  No ethanol flavor but pleasant gastric warming. Palate – 4.5 – Medium; watery; lively but soft carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4.5 Another excellent brew from RR.  Their combo of pediococcus, lactobacillus, brettanomyces and saccharomyces species yields a great tasting mixture of organic acids and other metabolic end products although as the temperature rises, the tannin begins to dominate.

Served in my new stemless CBC glass.  Brillian ruby color with excellent clarity and little head formation.  Mild aroma suggests a bit of tartness.  Flavor brings on a LOT of that tartness, approaching outright sour, but has a delicious ripe cherry flavor which complements the Brett nicely.  Sharp carbonation is suitable here. If I was more into sours I might find this outstanding.  I find it more drinkable than Cerise Cassée, and I really appreciate the balance here.  Unfortunately for me it's a balance between sour Brett and sweet cherries, not so much the oak and the brown ale underneath that I'd be more interested in. Apr 21, 2023 Report",3.73

Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass.  The aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk, but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way. Taste is wonderfully........different.  This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory.  The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting.  Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste.  Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated. Overall, very interesting and very good beer.

For now, let’s see what this one has to offer Pours a opaque brownish orange with 2 fingers of off white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing Wow, this is a full on assault in the nose and I’m loving it. I’m picking up on aromas of dark cherry, old leather, brown sugar, fresh oak, lemon yogurt, vanilla, rich red wine, light vinegar, caramel, and light plum It is just so rich in taste, and not really the sour bomb you expect from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, tangy red wine, fresh oak, lemon juice, toffee, apple skin, wet hay, and light cellar. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, stewed dark fruit, red wine vinegar, blackberry, black pepper, brown bread, and pear skin A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tangy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but tart enough to cut through most of it This is a fantastic beer. It's certainly one of (if not the) best Russian River Wilds I had in this run, and it swings in the same class as the best of the style. So delicious but I'm sad that I've finished my last bottle!

I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful. When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester,  a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness. The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness. The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry.  The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish. This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer! Oct 16, 2021 Report",4.84

There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness.

""Limit 2/customer"" a sign read, being the only beer brand back there it felt like I stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore, and with 100pt rating I just had to try it. im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100% and made me realize beers CAN be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits. I mean I made an account and am here now because of it right? Served chilled in a frosted pint glass. Brick red-orange colored, Head Came less than 1/4 inch up when i poured. First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other ""specialty beers"" and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable.

Cork immediately pushes upward as the cage is loosened, abd as I let go, it hurts out with a huge, forceful percussive *POP!* - flying several yards away. Some cork rot is visible. Pours a clear ruddy deep reddish copper-brown hue, topped woth a finger of coarse pinkish-brown head that quickly reduces to a thin collar, fed by streams of effervescence climbing the glass walls. Nose: Absolutely stunning right from the start. Bold, intense aromas of lightly toasted grains bringing a gentle caramel sweetness, big musty cherry that has begun to lose its battle with age, warm, fruity red wine notes, with just enough oxidation to lend some sherry and brandy characteristics, and a panoply of stewed dark fruits. There is a present, but balanced brettanomyces influence, lending the perfect amount of musty funk, forest floor, dusty cellar, petrichor, and this sort of morning-on-the-lake aroma. and it's all held together by a splintery oaken halo, which provides some leather, varnish, and old parchment. Beautiful. Palate: Supplication greets the palate drier than the aroma would lead one to believe. The grain peeks through just a touch, with a hint of dustiness, while the cherries, with all their sugars fermented out step up with big funky, mushy skin and pit notes. Interestingly, the wine character lacks all fruitiness, and reveals itself with dry, tannic, soaked cask notes. As it opens up, a plummy dark fruit note emerges midpalate. Acidity is mild to moderate, with a quick twinge upfront, and quickly extinguished by the dry, tannic, splintery white oak. There's plenty of musty, dusty brett funk, reminiscent of overripe apricot pits, but there's also this subtle earthy, almost mold-like funk that may very well be from cork rot. The finish is exceedingly dry, with plentiful woody oak. Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is light to medium-bodied, bright, snappy, and exceedingly crisp for nearly 8% ABV. The grains to lend some soft texture, and the fruit addition, while dry, does lend additional body. Effervescence is lively, zippy, and foams up over the palate. Tannic and drying. Overall: This is a very nice, classic fruited wild ale. I love the jammy stuff as much as the next person, but there's something beautifully rustic and raw about these ones. Every ounce of sugar has been fermented out, leaving a seriously musty, funky, fermented cherry flavour, relying on that touch of grain to give it body. The funk is very earthy, but plays well with the cherry, and the wine translates as mature, funky, wet oak - and lots of it. The subtle plummy notes are tasteful, and it all comes together to show the ale's depth and character. A fantastic offering. Sep 06, 2020 Report",

Sip Of Sunshine,"Reviewed by DarkPassport 3.88 /5 rDev -14.7% look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75 Appearance:  On draft in its home state of Vermont. A clear, deep golden color bordering a light shade of bronze. A thick finger of strong white head that left great lacing. Aroma:  The fresh squeezed juice of ripe tropical fruit along with miscellaneous floral hop notes.  Medium-light strength. Taste:  Heavy pine and resin up front, followed immediately but not overwhelmingly by some tropical fruit that should've been left on the tree a little longer.  The strong bitterness was reminiscent of the pith of the fruit rather than the juice. Feel:  Moderate to full body with nice carbonation that gives it a welcoming frothy feel. Overall:  It certainly has the kick of a DIPA but, interestingly, none of the bite expected from 8% ABV.  There is less tropical fruit and more pine than advertised. This doesn't make it a bad beer by any means, just not quite as described by the brewer. May 17, 2025 Report",3.88

Retention is good, lacing is abundant. Smell is juicy hops, citrus fruit (grapefruit, orange, trace amounts of lime), hints of grass. Taste is somewhat piney, grapefruit, rind, some WC dank, with good malty backbone. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, creamy, silky. Finish is a lingering bitterness. ABV is well hidden.

Canned 1/13/25. Appearance:  medium orange hue with a moderate haze and a finger of rich-ivory foam atop.  Looks good! Smell:  moderately sweet malt with a rather delicate lemony, grassy, herbal hop aroma.  It’s deceptively fragrant and easygoing for an 8% DIPA. Taste:  there’s a rich maltiness here that manages to deliver a good flavor without being too sweet.  Hops are still that deceptive sort of gentle candied lemongrass thing from the aroma, although there’s definitly a big shot of bitterness at the end.  A real classic DIPA, without being too harsh at all.  There’s maybe a little hint of booziness too but that passes quickly.  Really solid. Mouthfeel:  rich body with a good carbonation and a rich, smooth creaminess. Overall: dangerously drinkable at 8%, although the bitterness and (very slight) booziness do slow me down a little bit.  I can definitley see why this beer is so well-loved! Feb 13, 2025 Report",4.34

S: sweet, citrusy, candied orange, tangelo, hint of roasted pineapple. T: arrives dry, malty, on mid palate expresses mild citrus, slightly sweet, moderate piney bitterness on the finish. Compared to Heady, this is far less tropical and less bitterness on the finish. M: moderate weight; quite smooth; low carbonation, frothy mouthfeel, but clean for an 8% IPA. Struck by how drinkable this is. O: not as tropical, not as sweet, not as bitter as Heady, but far more drinkable. Not a hint of alcohol to be found on the palate; dangerous stuff. This is far more of a classic DIPA in my book, but a softer take. Can’t believe I just happened upon it at a grocery store in Philly. I think it’s Heady>Bodhi>Sip of Sunshine.

I was surprised to find I haven't rated it. Pours a nice amber-gold in the glass, with just a touch of haze.  Smell is piney citrus with some floral hints.  That sounds like any of 100 IPAs, but SoS has a really inviting smell. On the palate the first thing that hits is the bitterness and that lingers on the swallow, but between those points you get some malty sweetness and lots of fruit notes.  It drinks like a regular IPA - the 8% doesn't show in the taste, only in adding a bit of body to the mouthfeel. Vermont IPA (and DIPA) really deserve to be their own style(s).  This has way more in common with Alchemist and Fiddlehead IPAs than the NEIPAs it's often lumped together with. Sep 14, 2024 Report",4.49

Nose is so bright and vibrant; it’s like the can says, “tropical vacation,” but it’s clean and refreshing tropical; as if those tropical fruits had a pine like brightness, there is a little sweetness to it too. Taste is a moderate dose of maltiness; the tropical notes are back but cut deeply by resin and pine like quality in the hops; the do not fight one another but balance one another out. Medium in body, but definitely towards the higher end, biting and tingly bitterness on a quite clean finishing beer, there is a light warming from abv but the drinkability wins out; dangerously drinkable beer.

Pours a clear, deep straw-golden hue, with just a cast of unfiltered fog, and a finger of creamy, soft, off-white head, eventually settling to a thick collar leaving some lacing behind. Visible effervescence. Nose: Soft, pale rustic grains, with crackery wheat and some round malted barley lend secondary notes of wet hay, dewy grass, and some dusty silo. There is some remarkable floral character, lending spring blossoms like lilac and hyacinth, with lemon blossom, wet stony minerality, and a lightly musty oakiness. Some very restrained white vinous notes, along with a touch of pear, apple, and apricot. Gentle hints of honey, lemon zest, and some phenolic peppery notes wrap it all up in a beautifully soft and rustic olfactory display. Palate: Saison du Fermier greets the palate with simultaneous waves of gentle lemony tang, semi-sweet grist with some crackery, bready, and rustic grainy notes, and an explosion of bright, shimmery fruity notes. Lemon, nectarine, apricot, tart white plum, green apple, Asian pear, and a sweet-tart balance of fruity white grape. There's a bright but balanced minerality pushing these flavours to the front, along with some wet limestone. Some Belgian-like saison yeast brings that fruity, undertone with a bit of peppery spice intermingling with a touch of herbal hops. Finish is oaky, dry, and lightly tannic. Mouthfeel/Body: It's on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a tight, snappy crispness - bright and fluid, but there's enough grain to lend some softness and presence. Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy, but fine enough to stay soft and fluffy. Tart and wet up front, finishing with an increasingly dryness, and a touch of cling. Overall: A lot of the fruited and more recent Side Project offerings have been trending more and more acidic, which can really bring it down fast. This one shows the balance and softness that I know they're capable of. It retains much of that classic Belgian saison character, while contributing the classic Side Project culture and grist character. Soft, balanced, bright, and absolutely dialed in.

Super dark color with rich brown head. Totally opaque, head is very small and is soon totally gone, there is some lacing however. Strong scents of soy sauce and dark malt, I like this though it is bordering on being too strong. Taste, there is a lot here. Extremely rich, strong flavors of raw coconut, bourbon, soy sauce, roasted malts, licorice. It is delicious but it is simply too much. The beer is creamy and the finish is incredibly long.

Before getting into the flavor, I greatly appreciate this brew being offered in 12 oz bottles.  Though I enjoy drinking socially, I do most of my drinking solo, which makes those 16 oz plus bottles a challenge.  That might be the wimpiest thing I've said this week.  I should probably go start my lawnmower in one pull to make up for that.  As for the flavor, both the coconut and vanilla come through, but hold back from dominating the flavor profile.  I liken it to Phil Anselmo holding back in Cemetery Gates, unleashing at just the right time.  It goes without saying, but drink this one slowly, as the flavor profile changes as it warms.

Bourbon Paradise,"Reviewed by brewskis from Indiana 4.13 /5 rDev -9.4% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25 2019 version enjoyed 27 months later. Pours pitch black with a finger of fizzy, dark mocha, almost reddish head that fizzes away almost instantly. When swirled, it coats the glass with a dark film. Aroma is light coconut and even lighter vanilla as expected from the extended aging. This allows the base stout and barrel to shine more. Dark chocolate, black cherry, tobacco, roasted malt, some peat, and molasses from the base and some charred oak and bourbon from the barrel. Taste brings more of the adjuncts than expected given the aroma, but they're still quite light given today's ""pastry stout"" standards. Toasted coconut and light vanilla bean dance in the background while the barrel treated stout is at the forefront. Bakers chocolate, some bittersweet chocolate chip, roasted malt, some peat, tobacco, black cherry, some fig, molasses, some brown sugar, charred oak, bourbon spirit. I'm sure there's some vanillin and even possibly some coconut coming from the barrel, but it's hard to tell if that character is from the adjuncts or the barrel. Medium to high medium body. Slick, oily, sticky, warming. Could use a bit more body. Doesn't drink like 16%, but you know you're drinking a big beer. I know I shouldn't have sat on this as long as I did because I'm sure there was a lot more coconut and vanilla character; however, the base and barrel integration are top notch and allowing the adjuncts to subside has shown this. It also has led to what I'd imagine is a smoother drinking experience than when it was fresher. I'm sure a fresher version of this would meet my expectations more, but this is still a very enjoyable beer at where it's currently at. Jan 30, 2022 Report",4.13

Poured into a small-stemmed tulip. Too much upon the first sip. Of course, after the initial shock your taste buds acclimate a bit. But overall, this ale goes too far with is coconut, vanilla, and sweetness. Thought the barrel-aging contributes to these faults I do not believe that’s where the mistakes were made. 3.5 A – Pours an opaque oily black, viscous with zero head. Syrupy. An alcohol “wedge” (not legs) on the glass. 4.25 S – Sweet, vanilla, bourbon barrel, coconut is on the faint side and seems to be overwhelmed by the other aromas. There are some roasted aromas as well, but behind everything else. A very complex aroma. 4.0 T – Coconut!!! Sweet. Alcohol is well hidden. No bitterness. Sweetness is a combo of the coconut and the brown sugar flavors.

Beer is part of a swap with @Resistance88 thank you! The beer pours a thick , jet black coffee color with a dense brown head foaming up about 2 cm and gently cresting over the edge of my glass.  No spillage out and no light passing through either. Looks the part of an imperial stout for sure. the dense creamy head fades slowly to a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense coating lattice on each sip or swirl of the glass. The aroma on this beer is complex and enticing, there is some dark chocolate and a bit of roasted malts and almost charred note.  I also definitely get cinnamon, but its not artificial like Big Red, very earthy cinnamon note. Also some bourbon notes come through here. I dont get licorice that is on the label, which is okay as I dont tend to like anice/licorice aroma or flavor too much.  I dont get any booze here which is impressive at 13.3%.  Also not much if anything for a hop profile on the nose. First sip reveals a full, thick body with soft gentle and fine carbonation.  Beer feels nice on my palate and does give a bit of a coating on my lips with each sip. Flavor follows the notes advertised on the nose.  I get dark chocolate and some bourbon with hints of dark chocolate rolling through. Some warming and earthy cinnamon pops up, and this flavor lingers along with a bit of warmth, or is THAT the abv which was hidden on the nose??  Not really any char or heavy roast notes here.  The bourbon does come back very dominant on the burps.  Hops, we dont need no stinkin hops!  I dont get any on the flavor profile. So the warmth could be booze or cinnamon, its not hot, just slightly warm. The beer does drink pretty easy for its heft and I do enjoy it a lot.

The prior BA stout today I could have (and would have) consumed a bomber of, but this one somehow go through to me rational mind that finishing it tonight would not be wise.  So I'm testing the bottle sealer that so many have recommended. The feel was pretty typical BA stout, as the bottle was from 2019 it may have lost a bit of it's carbonation but that didn't spoil anything for me. Apr 16, 2022 Report",4.74

This title used to of course belong to Founders Breakfast Stout, but the restructuring of BA rankings shifted it to this. I am very excited to dive into this massive beast, which is also my first beer from Fremont. Let's see what this is all about Pours pitch black with 2 fingers of dark brown head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing Oh man, even after 2 years the cinnamon in this thing is still super prevalent. I'm picking up on aromas of cinnamon bark, milk chocolate, caramel, toasted oak, spicy bourbon, light char and black licorice. Very earthy and raw The earthy and spicy notes from the aroma is still present in taste, but it focuses much more on the smoother, somewhat sweet notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, fruity coffee, earthy cinnamon, caramel, toasted oak, and light raisin. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, spicy bourbon, dark chocolate, black licorice, dark cherry, molasses, and spent coffee beans A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy and lightly zesty beer. Finishes slightly sticky but dries over time. Decadent but not overly sweet This is a fantastic beer. It is incredibly creamy, balanced, and complex.

This is a very serious beer. Wow. Been chasing it for over a decade and happy to score a few back in 2020 and sitting on them for about a year and a half. Super sweet but not cloying, roasty and smoky without being off-putting. Pretty boozy in the nose, signifying it could use even more time to mellow. Luckily I have another bottle for years down the road. So smooth and easy-drinking but SO full of complex flavors. The best flavor in the finish is roasted marshmallows, without a doubt. Such a fun beer to drink. Epic stuff. Revisiting in late Nov 2024. This is damn strong but real smooth. Big time tobacco, leather, old licorice, damp earth. Cinnamon bark is still strong. Sweet yet subtle yet complex. This is truly heavy stuff. A definite sipper. Feb 14, 2022 Report",4.64

Poured into a snifter at 63°. It pours an oily black with a half finger of creamy, medium-mocha head and thin coating of lacing. Very pretty. Its smell offers roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt coffee, pepper, earthy char, and a strong bourbon aroma. The taste is sublime!  Like a dessert. It features dark chocolate, oatmeal, cinnamon, burnt coffee, anise, and a strong dose of bourbon. The flavors are distinct but blend magnificently. The result is delicious. The mouth feel is terrific:  thick and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and the 13.3% ABV is warming but not distracting.  Overall, The Rusty Nail is a magnificent Oatmeal Stout; the best example of the style I've had.  It excels in all categories. I'm grateful to have had the chance to enjoy it.

Received a 22 oz bomber in a LIF from @snaotheus.  Stored at home at 38 degrees.  Reviewed 24/10/21.  Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Served at 56.8 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Final temperature 60.4 degrees. Appearance – 4.25. First pour – Black (SRM 40), opaque. Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque.  When rear-lite, same, although some light does penetrate the edge and appears red. Head – Average (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density, fizzy, quickly diminishing to a one to four mm bubble ring and no cap.  Second pour produces a 0.9 cm head. Lacing – None, hardly unexpected at 12.3% ABV. Aroma – 3.75 – Initially weak licorice, no hops, no malt, no yeast, no cinnamon, faint bourbon as it warms, no oak. Flavor – 4.25 – Begins with the sweet taste of licorice and dates, no hops, no malt, no yeast.  No cinnamon.  Weak bourbon on the exhale with no oakiness.  No ethanol (12.3 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma.  Moderate gastric warming.  No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy approaching syrupy, soft carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4.25 This is one of those rare brews that looks the same in the glass as it does during the pour.  It has a bit of the candi sugar feel of a Belgian brew, a bit sweet.  The oats serve well, adding a luscious velvety feel across the palates.  Unfortunately for my taste buds, the cinnamon is deeply buried and I’m not sure if I’m actually tasting it or only hoping that I am.  As the temperature approaches 61 degrees, the alcohol begins to predominate, so it’s time to chug the remainder.  Overall, a decent brew but one that is temperature (and possibly age) dependent.

Since then I have tried a few BA offerings from Fremont and they have all been stellar. Plus the cinnamon in the B-bomb was amazing, so I took the leap this year. There is just so much here and no one element dominates. The licorice and cinnamon provide a nice counter punch to keep a sweet, chocolatey stout in check. The smoke and the bourbon barrels bring it all together perfectly. The bourbon notes are so damn good, no harsh wood or sharp alcohol. The body is full and rich. Just an amazing beer. Fremont's barrel program is among the best imo. Everything I've tried so far has had such rich, decadent barrel notes.

The Rusty Nail,"Reviewed by mschrei from Illinois 5 /5 rDev +9.6% look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5 This is the number 2 ranked Oatmeal Stout on this site, behind one of my favorite beers of all time, Founders Breakfast Stout, and that ranking is more than well deserved. What works the most for me is aging it on cinnamon. Oatmeal stouts shouldn’t have spice or heat, I thought, until I had this beer. The cinnamon is premonitory on the scent in a strong way, as it is the strongest characteristic on the nose. And then I taste it and I’d swear it’s a cinnamon beer. That’s not a bad thing, because wow! I don’t think I’ve ever had a beer that is this spice forward without overpowering everything else. Plenty of roasty malt and a strong bourbon presence, but that spiciness makes this a unique experience. Medium to big bodied feel, which is surprising, cause I expected this to be a big ass beer. It’s not, nor is it thick or sticky or oily. It’s a kind of “medium in all ways” type of feel, if that makes sense, except it as boozy as hell, which is another turn on for it. Honestly, this may be one of the best beers I’ve had in a while, and I wish I could order more from Tavour. When you encounter a just about perfect beer, you know it. I’m not one of those guys who doesn’t give perfect scores, and maybe this isn’t perfect. Maybe if I examine it more, I’d lower it. But with the impression I’ve gotten over the last two hours letting it develop, I’m going with 5’s across the board right now. I’m glad I got into Tavour just because of Fremont access.

There's a beautiful red tint that adds a certain brilliance to this as it pours out of the bottle.  In the glass it disappears and just becomes a meh dark brown with a little bit of head, but man was the pour itself attractive. Molasses lead the way on the nose, with some faint fig like notes lurking underneath. It's very rich smelling, but in the best possible way.  Perhaps rethinking my decision to enjoy this in the morning vs. evening, but there's never a wrong time to drink good beer, right? Raisins & figs are more prominent on the tongue than the nose, particularly early in my first few sips. Caramel and toffee start to take a more prominent role with subsequent sips, emerging even more on the long finish.  Wonderful subtle alcohol warming, and this coats the mouth very nicely.

Leathery bourbon finish. Medium bodied with moderate creaminess, nice mouth feel, although slightly light in carbonation. I can taste the fine base Fourth Dementia in this ale and it really shows its bourbon barreling, although mostly bourbon flavor and not that much wood or oak. The base flavors seem more concentrated and melded, which makes sense for something aged for a while. Rich and flavorful. I have to admit, as a malt fan, that I think I actually like the base better; the malt takes second place to the barrel in this one and it was exquisite in the base Dementia. On the other hand, it's a fine old ale with bourbon treatment, which is a great thing in itself. I hope to get an opportunity to get these again in the future; I'll grab both versions.

It is lovely and I slightly prefer this over the non BA version. The black tea notes here but bitterness is largely blunted by a lovely boozy butterscotch flavor.

Aromas open to fresh prune laden with prickly oak as accents of fig wash through an encroaching bourbon undercurrent sporting progressive dark cocoa and edgy vanillins detailing. Taste brings saucy prune and stewed dates upfront, with notes of dusty cocoa and charry oak encroaching on Werthers Originals past the mid-palate into smoked toffee meeting distant undertones of burnt vanilla on the back end of the profile. Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body and a robust fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing an airy char to a steadily cleaning roast washing over the  mid-palate, a quiet warmth trailing into a bright twang integrating effortlessly toward the finish. A daring fusion of barrel and brightness in a profile saturated with near-syrupy dark fruit reductions and a tempering, deft level of cocoa char; an exceedingly bold, almost authoritative expression of the style executed with adept clarity.

Intense flavor, but hides the alcohol really well. Strong, but not in any way boozy. Enjoyable sipper Apr 26, 2022 Report",4.52

Bought this beer on a Monday at the brewery transported it home stuffed in my steel-toed boot in my luggage on a flight back to DC. Poured into a small-stemmed tulip. I drank this beer on the following Friday evening at home to celebrate my first day in the new office. Very happy I did not wait. This is the first barrel-aged old ale that I’ve had. A barrel-aged beer that the brewer “did right.” But I still may have taken this beer out of the barrels earlier. The high ABV and the sweetness might make you think you are drinking a barleywine. Complex is an understatement. 4.5 A – Pours a hazy deep reddish brown but opaque in the glass with a thin tan head with reddish highlights. Constant thin head. Good carbonation. Viscosity on the glass. Some lacing. 4.5 S – A rich but oxidized aroma of vanilla and caramel, with some slight metallic. 4.25 T – Caramel, brown sugar, then the vanilla with finally the barrel spirits in the background. Not as much barrel in the taste as the aroma might lead you to believe. The oxidized or metallic notes are very sedate. Vinous qualities as wells, some raisins soaked in bourbon. No hoppiness that I can discern. 4.75 MF – Medium heavy body with a sweetish finish. Slick and a bit coating. Let this beer linger on the palate and the oxidation rises up just a little. 4.5 Apr 08, 2022 Report",4.54

Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by hoptheology from South Dakota 4.43 /5 rDev -2.6% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 12 oz bottle, 2018 vintage, cellar treat, sent from Junior, into a Prairie Rastal glass. This marvelous beer pours a wonderful raisin color with a harvest gold head of 1/4 finger. Recedes to a polite fingernail and stays. Swirling leaves a few micro legs. Aroma is that of a really settled-in beer. Like this one has had some time to really develop and mature into what it is. Tons of wonderful aged dates and raisins, with shoe leather, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and fig. Hints of chocolate, and a nice hot alcohol aroma envelopes the whole thing. Toffee and raisins start this one off, followed by a burnt char note and some piney hop, and then the sweetness returns with caramel and sticky fig, some paper/cardboard, and then fades out on tobacco and molasses. Very complex. A bit sharp and bitter, I'd prefer a little more smoothness, but this flavor profile is bonkers. Feel is sticky all the way to the bank with heat throughout but a cooling center. Moderate buzzing carbonation paired with warming alcohol that coats the gums and tongue. Leaves a bit of resin on the finish. Overall, this is a really wonderful barrel aged old ale and one I'd try to find again. I do believe I liked their BA stout better, but this is absolutely no slouch. Price paid : Trade Would find/buy again : Yes Sep 03, 2020 Report",4.43

There was actually a 1 finger tan head on this beer. It didn't last too long, and there's no lacing on the glass. The nose, well, it's a very strong nose. Very boozy smelling. Lots of caramel, and toffee. Raisin, and dates as well. I'm also getting just a fain hint of coffee. Taste - Up front I get more of the dates and raisin. Tons of toffee, and that comes in on the backside, along with the caramel. Not really getting the coffee I was smelling. This beer isn't as boozy feeling as I was expecting. That being said, this beer is so thick, and full bodied. It actually goes down so smooth. World class stout, and so damn happy to try it. Apr 28, 2020 Report",4.85

Beautiful clear caramel gold colour with a good finger plus of just off white foam. Soft and velvety with sprinkled large bubbles, it sticks to the glass as it recedes. Nose is a great showcase for citra hops, and that works for me, because citra is a great hop! There's some citrus, some pine, some kind of light honeysuckle and wonderful rich complementary caramel malts underneath. Flavour isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it presents all the goodies. Bitter citrus and pine, some caramel malts, some round fruits... finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means. It's mostly in the pith/citrus side of things, but not the full on acid bomb of like a Monkish, and it's balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance. This is just a phenomenal beer all around, and right up my alley. I love what I've tried from Kern River, and I can see why both Tim and Derek both independently thought I should try this beer.

A nice looking IIPA for my tastes. Smell: Citrus, tropical fruit aromas and moderate pine aromas. Nothing to fault with the nose. Taste: Moderately tart grapefruit/citrus notes, moderate tropical fruit notes and mild pine notes. Some mild bready notes from the malts to counter all the hop notes. The beer has a strong hop backbone that provides a fairly dry finish that lets the fruity notes die off gradually. Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a generous level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is spot on for an IIPA. Overall: A great IIPA.

L: Eschews classic West Coast IPA visual with a slightly more opaque and deeper color than other classics of the style. Beautiful lacing on glass after some sips, yet head dissipates rather quickly. This has little bearing on the beer overall personally, a minor complaint. S: Lovely nose of tropical notes. Smells of fruit and citrus, not an overpoweringly strong scent yet clearly expresses the flavor profile to expect. T: Citrus and fruit flavor explodes here. Measured bitterness reminds that this is a West Coast IPA, yet has a juiciness that has come to be associated with NEIPAs nowadays. Hoppy and fruity, taste follows suit on the nose and then some. F: Perfectly measured medium body, finishes on the dry side yet the tropical fruit and citrus notes linger for some time. O: My third experience with Citra, I think I can conclude that this is my favorite West Coast IPA of them all. The juicier and sweeter characteristics of it as opposed to other notable examples of the style put it over the edge as a truly original and exciting beer. Drank fresh, it is an absolute revelation in a time where the IPA market is oversaturated and often difficult to get excited about. Seek it out! Mar 26, 2021 Report",4.86

I find that when someone can do a lower abv (6.6%) with a lot of flavor that that is more an achievement than knocking out a DIPA. My pallet generally goes toward liking the higher abvs, but I need the lower one once in awhile when having more than one beer in a sitting. I am loving the balance in bitterness here more than anything. The Midwest brewers love to land on the sweeter side, but I actually like the dryer bitter finishes more. The beer does lack quite a bit on the nose as I am not getting much beyond some citrusy hop notes buried deep. The feel is full and smooth. Overall a great beer.

The malt has a candylike flavor that reinforces the hop flavors. F: Medium/full body, lowish carb, very Lush. Overall: A really good beer that is just a little short of being great due to some off notes from the hops.

Looks opaque, milky yellow with a frothy white head. Lots of hop aromas and flavors. Full and bursting with tropical fruit and citrus pulp character. Clear and direct, not a complex beer but the hops are full and strong. Feels medium body, soft carbonation and juicy with little to no bitterness. Overall really excellent. Glad I could pick some up! I don't always knock points for style guidelines but I did here. Sure it's great and that's how they do things at Trillium but I like pale ales to be clear and crisp. It really should be qualified as a NE IPA but the brewery calls it a pale ale. I suppose the base beer without the double dry hop might be a little crisper, but still... Feb 29, 2020 Report",4.35

Aroma is earthy papaya, tangerine and grapefruit with a little stone and yeast beyond. It's tropical fruit opening lingers for a while, letting the base pale ale (which is already very hoppy) show throw in fragments. Aroma is akin to a very powerful NE IPA. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, mango, tangerine with a little earthy, nutty malt and raw grain and yeast to sooth things out. It's tropical fruit through and through, and drinks very similar - identical - to Trillium's Northeast IPA (this is labeled as an American Pale Ale at the time of review). All this to say, it's incredible hop forward, much more so than other pale ales, which may be a deterrent for some. Mouth feel is a little gritty, silty and soft, with a medium-thick consistency. It's liken to a well-worn lumpy, linen pillow. Overall, despite a slightly misleading style, the name of the beer lets those knowledgeable about beer that the hop content is going to be high, thus I will not knock it for the style mis-interpretation. It's big and flavorful, which is welcome in a beer. It combines well with the lightly gritty texture to develop a refined, but well-worn and knowledgeable, experience.

Fort Point Pale Ale -  Galaxy Dry Hopped,"Reviewed by Roguer from Connecticut 4.57 /5 rDev +0.4% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5 Classic hazy, opaque, and nearly pulpy New England look; mango-orange body. Strong head production, with about a finger and a half of off-white foam from a gentle pour. Retention is solid. Aroma is just bursting with hops: bright herbs (mint, oregano, basil), waves of citrus (mandarin orange, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit), tropical fruit (melon, mango, strawberry, peach), and a honey cracker malt base beneath it all. Brew delivers the same character to the palate. There's a chewy, grainy, crackery malt bill in the background, reminding you this is an APA, while still allowing the hop character to shine. Bright, minty herbs; biting citrus; mild pine and resin; and to a lesser prominence, some juicy tropical tones. Flavor profile matches the nose in terms of individual tones. More bitter than you might expect, favoring grapefruit, lemon, and citrus peel a touch more than other fruit. Quite biting for the New England style, but very appropriate for an APA. Still quite creamy; surprisingly astringent. Apr 13, 2019 Report",4.57

Aromas of hop citrus - tangerine and grapefruit come with a side of pine needles.  A moderate sweetness on the nose translates to the opening of the taste, giving the lightly toasted malt a raw honey edge.  It doesn’t take long for the candied orange to turn pithy.  There’s a ring grapefruit and passion fruit note to keep things from jumping off the bitter edge.  But thankfully, there is a slow decent into herbal, piney, and slightly earthy bitterness.

Let sit out for 15 minutes , before opening. Lightly hazy orangey-gold, with about 1.5 fingers of pale orangey-tan head. Leaves behind about 1.25"" of 1/3 coverage  streaky & spotty lacing, and a thin surface sheet, with a small mound of foam in the center. Smell is light candied orange rind, a vague mix of fresh citrus, a bit of light pine, and some fresh-biscuit malt aroma . Taste is a sweet orange rind flavor, but that of freshly-peeled orange rind that's been sweetened, rather that the usual dried /cooked[i.e., like marmalade]  flavor. As such, it's also a bit sweeter than the usual too.  Near finish, there's some faint pine, plus a touch of cooked sweet onion flavor (rather than the usual raw green onion). Very slight bitterness adds some balance towards finish,  and lingers  beyond. Brief, slight bread crust appears just as the liquid disappears. Feel is heavy-side-of-medium, which  actually seems lighter I would expect, given the aroma,taste, and abv.  Slight drying effect after finish.  A light internal warming feeling shows up after two or three sips, but no alcohol heat on the palate, or at the back of the throat. Overall, pretty good. Better than all but one  TIPA that I've had* . A little sweeter than I prefer, but not TOO much. Dangerously easy-drinking. That said, other than as an abv delivery device, (if you want that) I still don't see anything to recommend it over the DIPA, or normal version. All-in-all, a pleasant experience, though I prefer normal Sip just a tad more. :) * Brain Bucket, from Water Street Brewing (Binghamton,NY, not the Milwaukee brewery) .

That familiar Sunshine nose of Mango, Peach, some papaya as well. Honey sweetness, papaya, honeydew melon, some residual resinous bitterness. You can definitely feel the heat which is quite fusel. It's like an underpinning of some vodka or something, so it really has the taste of booze soaked fruit. A bit astringent on the finish.

The nose is fragrant and fruity with ripe cantaloupe, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, and bubblegum. Its taste is big and bold; quite sweet with ripe melon and tropical fruit balanced by lemon, grapefruit rind., and onion.  It's super dank and dense in flavor.  There is herbal, piney bitterness throughout. I wish the hop bill were more apparent.  It's also noticeably boozy. The mouth feel is super plush and thick, almost syrupy, with moderate carbonation, and if anything it drinks bigger than the 10.5% ABV.  Overall, Triple Sunshine is a tour de force.

There were some faint citrus and grassy parts but not at all what I expected.   Wonderful smell. The taste is even better, holy cow I wish this was a crowler as 12oz went by way too quickly. Honey leads and just subtlety wraps up the hops and any malts with smooth gentleness.  I think I could drink a gallon of this but for the ABV.

This definitely did not resemble your typical New England IPA. A patchy blanket of drippy lacing coated the glass and stuck around for quite a while. The aroma was outstanding initially but transformed significantly as the beer warmed. Tropical fruits leapt from the glass. Passionfruit was most apparent. Lots of honey drizzled mango as well. Fairly sweet overall. Citrus fruits were also noticeable. Juicy orange notes came to mind. Bit of tangerine too. As the beer sat, the tropical fruit notes subsided and citrus took over. Later, the passionfruit reappeared. The flavor profile was quite fruity and sweet. Citrus notes came through strongest. Loads of juicy orange and tangerine flesh. Bit of citrus rind-like pith too. The beer was anchored by a stiff malty backbone. Big pineapple presence in the center. Sugar coated ruby red grapefruit notes appeared on the back end and carried into the finish. Pithy, bitter, grapefruit rind-like notes lingered after the swallow. With time, the sweetness really intensified. Excellent creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. Lighter bodied for the style. The liquid contained a super fine, fairly zippy effervescence that turned super smooth on the palate. For a 10.5% ABV beer, the alcohol was well hidden. Although this beer no longer garners the hype that it once did, I can definitely understand its appeal. Triple Sunshine was a nice reminder as to how New England-style IPAs once were.

Currently ranked #8 in the Imperial IPA category and #85 in the top 250 overall beers list - not too shabby! ""Triple IPA."" 10.5% ABV. Served chilled into a stemmed snifter. APPEARANCE: Head is quite healthy and robust for a 10.5% ABV ale, easily lasting 8-10 minutes. White in colour with some froth and cream to it...has a good consistency. Body colour is a vibrant pale copper. Clear enough, and seemingly filtered. Free of yeasty sediment, lees, etc. It's an appealing appearance for an IIPA, no doubt. AROMA: Pineapple, mango, fresh floral hop aromatics, juicy lychee, Mandarin orange slime, maybe a kiss of faint grapefruit. Malts seem to be pale/2-row and maybe caramalt? Appealing, though it doesn't promise a dazzling hop profile. TASTE & TEXTURE: I've got to tip my hat to Lawson's; this disguises its 10.5% ABV dangerously well. Slimy lychee and Mandarin orange make an appearance, but aren't accompanied by a slippery mouthfeel; this beer's texture is actually fairly coarse, helping bring out what little grapefruit pith there is without scraping the palate too much. Perfectly carbonated. Mouthfeel is in the happy medium between wet and dry. It's not refreshing, but cmon - it's 10.5% ABV. I don't get any pine, lemon-lime, overt orange citrus, onion/garlic, or berry flavours. Mostly, it's a fruity IIPA that doesn't overcommit to the overdone tropical fruit hop profile I expected it to. Pineapple does make an appearance, but it's welcome. Mouthfeel does accentuate the taste. It's a well balanced and shockingly drinkable IIPA, sure, but I don't think its hop profile dazzles. Any top rated IIPA is going to invite comparisons to Pliny the Elder, and for my money Russian River's effort is a substantially better beer if only because I like its hop profile more and it boasts better depth of hop flavour...there's no equal here to the pungent pine found in Pliny or the insanity of flavour observed in Bell's Hopslam. OVERALL: This won't make my personal Top 250, but it's a respectable IIPA with dangerous drinkability and good balance. I'm glad I got to try it, and I think it's a step above something like Lagunitas Sucks, but it doesn't unseat something like Pliny The Elder, Hopslam, or Port's (criminally underregarded) Hop 15 in my book.

I'm just happy I went to look around for more beer after I got my bottles of Bourbon County from the front counter, or else this probably would've been gone by the next time I went back. I'm a bit disappointed I'm not trying Double Sunshine before moving up to this, but I'm thrilled either way. Currently the 8th highest rated Imperial IPA and 85th overall on BA. Let's crack it open Pours a clear orange gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal spotty lacing The nose is absolutely huge on this one, juicy floral hops playing off a massive malt bill. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, tangerine rind, floral hops, bready malt, caramel, pineapple, dank weed, and light honey Holy hell, this is just stupidly juicy in taste, every last flavor just pops. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange juice, caramel malt, white pepper, pithy grapefruit, white grape, and toasted bread. The swallow brings notes of juicy lychee, honeydew melon, tangerine, dank weed, bready malt, lemon rind, and resinous weedy hops A medium body pairs with gentle airy carbonation, resulting in a very smooth beer. Finishes off dry and increasingly sweet This shit is incredible. It's massive and evenly balanced between malt and hop characteristics. I can't believe this is only like $4 for a single can. I grabbed 2, but absolutely need more Nov 26, 2021 Report",4.57

Body is hazy with some fine particulate out of suspension in a dark orange and translucent body. Aroma is wonderfully hoppy and inviting, with huge notes of orange, ruby red grapefruit, caramel, pepper, white bready dough, mango, pineapple. It's layered with hops and malts, with every sniff revealing more and more. The history of IPAs above 10% ABV reveals some gems, but a whole lot of boozy, hot, syrupy messes. This one isn't just a gem; it's a star. Sweet and juicy, bold but not harsh, equally balanced between hop and malt expression, bitter but not astringent. Flavor notes of orange, lemon, grapefruit, melon, white grape, pineapple, white dough, caramel, maple, vanilla. Smooth and full bodied, not the slightest bit syrupy or harsh. This is a world-class IIIPA that more than lives up to its reputation and Lawson's stellar legacy. Nov 19, 2021 Report",4.63

Until now. Pour is stout black with a 1 cm light brown head which left rings of lacing. The important part: the taste. It’s not like either of the stouts that make up the blend, or maybe cuvée. It’s a touch more coffee forward than Double Cream Stout and much less roasty than Expedition stout. It *is* amazingly tasty with smooth coffee and chocolate and daaaark fruits.

Figured I do an expected great beer for my 3000th Review!! Lets go. Pouring the beer into my trusty snifter.  The beer was bottled on 10/31/2023, received in a BIF this month. Pours into my glass a solid black coffee color with a dense creamy tan head of .5 cm.  the foam fades to a sturdy surface covering that remains through the sampling.  i get some nice tight lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip. Aroma is roasted  malt, dark chocolate, some black licorice or anice note, bourbon notes and hints of black pepper.  No hop character on the aroma and not fusol, but I believe the black pepper note is booze hint. First sip reveals a fairly thick body with smooth texture and full mouthfeel.  Fine and tingly carbonation. Nice physical traits. Flavor is similar to the nose with high cacao dark chocolate, some black licorice, and finishes with some slightly sweet bourbon.  Again no hop character on this beer. There isnt really a lot of boozy warmth on the finish here either. Pretty straight forward solid barrels aged stout, good complexity and blend of flavors.  Very happy to have checked this beer and enjoying this tasty stout.  The hidden ABV could be dangerous. Well worth seeking out. Mar 22, 2024 Report",4.54

I drank this last night but wasn't able to write it up. 12oz bottle, my friend drank half and gifted the rest of the bottle for me.  He had suggested that we drink it together but our schedules didn't match up and he wanted to crack it open.  No bottling date.  This is the 2017 vintage, so this beer is probably 5 1/2 to 6 years old! Look: Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with impressive carbonation for a six-year-old bourbon barrel-aged stout.  There was a thin brownish-colored head that reduced to a wispy layer.  The head regenerates temporarily after swirling the glass. Smell: Up front, the aromas on this beer (at least at this age) are all umami, all the time.  It has that rich, interesting soy sauce note that is blended with dark chocolate and subtle dried fruit aromas.  Secondary notes of vanilla and amaretto. Taste: I am really impressed that this beer has aged so well.  I was expecting it to be dull and flat.  But it is really smooth, rich, very flavorful.  It's also really drinkable and there is basically no heat on the palate.  The umami flavor is really nice and then the beer has a nice dark chocolate richness.  The beer has subtle sweetness, and the finish is mildly bitter with nice roasted malt character.  The amaretto note is also really nice. Feel: It's not thin and it's not especially thick either.  It's somewhere in the middle, I would say that it is medium plus bodied.  The mouthfeel is nice with soft carbonation. Overall: It's very tasty and really enjoyable.  I've never had this before.  It would be nice to get a fresh batch of this beer and enjoy one every year to see how it develops over time. Apr 01, 2023 Report",4.25

I was sent this in a box by a fellow beer friend. Using a tulip glass, I served the beer at 52 degrees. The pour created a one in half finger length head with dismal retention.  No lacing was left on the glass after the quick dissipation. Charting the color of the beer somewhere around SRM 34, dark brown, nearly black. The appearance is slightly above average, regardless of the head retention. Nosing the glass, I detected bourbon, oak, espresso, dark chocolate, cream, oats, raisins, molasses, caramel, toasted bread, dark roasted malts, a hint of char, and a notion of floral. Sipping the beer, I taste bourbon, oranges, oak, resin, molasses, milk chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, caramel, toffee, toasted bread crust, oats, a tinge of soy sauce, a hint of Maillard, and a little smoky char. The mouthfeel is thick and coated. The body is a medium plus, has low carbonation, and has a delicious finish. This beer held up beautifully.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to quaff on this stout.  Thank you kindly for allowing to have this chance to try a retired beer.  Simply a fantastic beer! Jan 08, 2023 Report",4.46

Pours a deep, dark mahogany brown, sitting absolutely inky jet black in the glass. A super short head of coarse dark tan bubbles forms, before quickly receding to a razor-thin, but,persistent collar. Nose: Definitely that Bell's barrel-aged aroma here. Much like BA Expo, which makes up half of this, there's a big, dense fudgy aroma, with plenty of dark cocoa-like roast, caramel, and marzipan, with secondary notes of American tobacco, vanilla, leather, and bourbon barrel. There are some signs of age here - mildly faded aroma, as well as some unique notes - musty, a whisper of umami, with a hint of fresh spearmint, and a metallic penny note as well, the latter of which is slightly detracting, but only slightly. Palate: Black Note greets the palate malt-first, with a moderate sweetness. Dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, toffee, roasted malts, and a surprising fruitiness. Big plummy dark fruit notes - mainly prune, plum, dried cherry, and bourbon-y apple lend a bright fruity pop, with a touch of acidity. This dark fruit element cuts through much of the malty sweetness, creating a shortcut for the roastiness to come in. Dark malts, barrel char, roast, and cacao nib begin to build a mild-moderate bitterness, and the bourbon character begins to bloom. At this point, it begins to dry out fast, roast taking over the sweetness, and dark fruits fading, as the beer barrels towards a finish with nutty malted milk, hazelnut, cocoa powder, a bit of black roast, barrel char, and ultimately concludes with dry oak and a lingering vanilla cream note. Body: I cannot say whether or not this is the age, but this one is definitely thin. Unlike BA Expo, or even Vanilla Black Note (which was not a super thick stout), this one is definitely a little runny, lacking any and all chew or viscosity. Definitely some effervescence, and it's fairly full (perhaps medium-full) bodied, but it's very fluid and thin. Overall: With Barrel-Aged Expedition being a personal favourite of mine, I had high hopes for this one. I'm thinking maybe BA Expo is really just the best qualities of this in one thread. It's a perfectly delicious bourbon barrel-aged stout, with a particularly fine malt balance and unique creamy nuttiness, but with its subdued aroma, dry delivery, and ultra-thin body, it falls short for me. Super drinkable, if that's what you want, but I find the Vanilla variant far superior, and BA Expo to be the ultimate expression. Dec 28, 2020 Report",4.17

Bottled 11/3/2016. Into North Coast snifter. We didn't know what Coronavirus was back then. Inky, silky black with a small beige head of bubbles. Recedes to a fingernail with some remaining bubbles on top. Aroma is chock full of tobacco and fig, with some dry bakers cacao and piney hop right behind it. Lots of roasted malt and karo syrup as well. Flavor brings dry cigarette ash mingled with dry cacao and hints of chocolate. Some raisin and pine follow up shortly after. Finish is of leather, grass, very dry bakers cacao, and hints of raisin. I do not get any bourbon barrel. Feel is slick with a heavy carbonation and a boozy burn though not too much. Slick, resinous finish. Overall, this beer fared better for me this time and fares a lot better than many 4 year old beers. This is absolutely a good beer, but the Vanilla Black Note is way better. Price paid : $5.99 / bottle in 2016 Would buy again : Yeah I'd give it a swing Initial review : January 15th, 2017 Oily black with a beige-brown head. Aroma of old moldy oak barrel, meat locker, snuff tobacco, leather, cigarette butts, and slight vinegar. Flavor is a touch milky to start (somewhat thin), but then forms a bit more character with tobacco, earth, and finally on the finish it all comes together - bourbon, rich chocolate, oats, and leather on the aftertaste. Feel is thin to start, then begins a medium profile, and finally a thick juicy finish with a roasty dryness. Overall, this is the 2nd 2016 bottle I've had this year, and I remember the first one being better. This seems to have some issues regarding smelling a bit vinegary and ashy, with the flavor really lacking until the finish. I remember the first bottle being flavorful all the way through. Sad, but I have one more bottle I can take care of yet before my 2016 stash is depleted. Rated with price in mind ($6/bottle). 4.25 / 3.75 / 4 / 3.75 / 4 = 3.93 Aug 17, 2020 Report",4.14
Black Note Stout,"Reviewed by AmeriCanadian from Tennessee 4.5 /5 rDev -0.9% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5 Pretty high bar to set, describing it as sharing qualities with Expedition and the feel of Double Cream.  Also a beer that I've long wanted to try.  But my first experience largely lived up to the high billing. Jet black body with cola-brown edges.  Not as viscous or thick as I expected, but it's certainly a big and bold looking stout.  Handsome mocha cap of latte head that collapses quite quickly but leaves a strong circumferential ring of chocolate foam that provides spotty lacing down the glass.  Swirls of the glass produce moderate alcohol legs and renewed mocha film that compliments the jet black coloring extremely well. The aroma and taste profile is as expected, with huge bursts of dark chocolate, roasty and toasty malts, divine dark fruits, exotic woods, licorice, brown sugar, and barrel char.  The nose is masterfully layered, with no single note dominating and each whiff leading with something different.  On the tongue you get an added streak of whiskey heat and molasses sweetness, with strong barrel personality -- toffee, oak, and a little maple -- standing out.  There's perhaps just a tad too much black licorice for my liking, but that's pretty nit-picky.  It's not a sweet stout, at all, but the semi-sweetness and strong bitterness balance each other out beautifully. Feel is thinner than I expected and was hoping for (especially given the Double Cream reference), but it's incredibly smooth and silky with just a wee bit of stickiness.  Reasonably carbonated and very little boozy heat. Jan 25, 2020 Report",

It poured an opaque rich dark amber with thin tan head that did not leave much lace. The scent had bold bourbon and malty notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip with semi sweet dark chocolate malt base with bourbon, dark fruit, dark chocolate and vanilla presence. The mouthfeel was fuller in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer. May 04, 2025 Report",4.81

Got it from @2beerdogs with a handshake in California last year. Pours black, smooth, dark brown along the edges, not much head on the pour and not much more than a lumpy ring after. Smell is boozy, dates, burnt molasses and dark coffee. Taste is boozy, leans into the dates and sticky toffee pudding vibe, more nuts and tea than I expected. Coffee is noticeable but muted. Almost a Belgian thing going on here. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, a little on the still side. Overall, interesting and tasty, going to be fun to enjoy this as it warms up over the next few hours. --- 2025-02-22 2023 bottle. Stays away from the dates, more in the molasses direction, lots of vanilla and chocolate. Mouthfeel is lovely velvet. I'd rate this a little higher than my original review of a 9-year-old 2016.

Black Tuesday,"Reviewed by Darkmagus82 from Texas 4.09 /5 rDev -9.9% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4 2023 vintage at 19.5 % abv poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter Appearance – The beer pours thick with a pitch-black color and a small tan colored head forms onto the surface of the brew, the result of tiny brown bubbles that stream up through the liquid.  The head fades super quickly, leaving whisps of lace on the sides of the glass.  Swirling the brew in the glass further reveals its stickiness with fingers of brew clinging to the sides of the glass and very slowly fading back to the base of the snifter when agitation is done. Smell – The aroma is huge with tons of molasses and brown sugar mixed with dark fruit of cherry, plum, and a massive level of raisin.  Along with these aromas is the dark and roasty malt one may expect with some char and smoke mixed in there as well.  At the same time the booziness can be sensed with a warming bourbon smell.  There are also notes of vanilla sweetness and a good showing of wood, rounding out the other sweet and boozy well.  Black licorice and a big shot of toast and milk chocolate brownies finish it all out, producing a very sweet, rich, and dark aroma overall. Taste – The taste follows the nose in the size with a massive roasted malt flavor mixed with tons of sweetness.  The roasted flavors are a mix of dark roasted malt and some coffee, along with some light smoke and char.  The sweet upfront is mainly of molasses and brown sugar along with a heavy presence of raisin and plum.  There are notes of vanilla and caramel as well as some wood and char as well adding more dimension to the sweet and roast.  At 19.5 %, not surprisingly the alcohol is noticed, starting out lighter and getting more intense and more bourbon like in nature as the taste advances on the tongue.  At the same time the sweet gets more intense as well, all while the roast fades just a touch.  Some light bitter coffee flavors come more towards the end of the flavor profile, all while a bit more char joins in.  At the end the booziness surges, all while a touch of crème joins in, leaving one with a boozy and very rich and roasty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – Not surprisingly, the brew is thick and syrupy, having a lower level of carbonation.  For the big flavors, booze, and dark roastiness, the feel is very appropriate, making this one a very slow sipper. Overall – Massive and big. Certainly, a sipper.  With the intensity, it is slightly cloying, but also contains a level of balance.  Interesting brew.  I don’t think I would buy another bottle, but am glad I at least gave it a try.

Appears coffee color, small head that recedes to a thin collar around the glass. Some light lacing. Aroma is bourbon, boozy, sweet malts, molasses, caramelized brown sugar. Taste follows the nose. Molasses, bourbon, brown sugar, some vanilla notes, raisins. Pure decadence. Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied. Decent carbonation leaves a velvety texture. There is good warming going on....the 20% ABV will do that. BUT....the alcohol is extremely well concealed under the deep flavors. This is a big boy beer for sure. This isn't a ""drink a 6 pack"" type of craft brew. This is a sip and savor a bottle on a cold night sort of thing. Really tasty. The bourbon notes shine thru. It is a little sweet at first taste but the bourbon notes and slight bitter mouthfeel tend to balance things out. This was a very expensive splurge at 30$/bottle from Bound Beverage in Warrington, PA but that is apparently the going price. Would I buy it again? Probably.

There is some fresh dark fruit detected, and an astringency that suggest red wine. Finish is initially a little harsh, but then smoothed out to a lasting bourbon warmth.

Poor retention, but surprisingly a thin ring does remain. Smelled booze as soon as I cracked the bottle.  Straight up bourbon.  A closer sniff reveals tons of bourbon as expected, butterscotch, toasted oak, caramel, vanilla, very sweet and rich dark chocolate, toasted marshmallow, tobacco, prune, milk chocolate, and black licorice. It's still fairly cold--only been out of the fridge about 10 minutes--but the dark chocolate, molasses, toast, and caramel hit you upfront.  Taste is surprisingly and dangerously smooth.  Surprisingly, it doesn't lean heavily on cloy of dark chocolate/caramel/vanilla, though there is that.  It actually leans fruity; candied plum, black cherry, and fig.  Charred oak tannins contribute nudges of red wine.  Tobacco, leather, and smoke on the mid-palate.  Heavy char; black coffee and burnt toast.  Bourbon warmth takes over, zinging and drying out the palate.  Heavy astringency.  The sweetness hits you on the finish--slick, oily, syrupy--but the booze and heavy tannins keep it in check.  The finish lingers with chocolate, coffee, fruit leather, bourbon, and smoke. Feel is lighter than expected but still heavy.  Oily, slick, greasy, sugary.  Medium to medium carbonation; it moves rather quickly on the palate.  Mouthfeel is more like a carbonated brandy or port than your typically milkshake-like imperial stout. How do I feel about this beer overall?  It's hard to give an honest opinion, because everyone is so biased about it that it affects our collective judgment.  It's very good and mold-breaking, but maybe not 100.  I prefer the thicker feel and chocolate-coffee forward taste of other imperial stouts that are lower-abv.  (Because I'm getting old lol) Definitely don't regret buying/trying it, but I don't think I will again unless I share it with several other people. Mar 24, 2024 Report",

Let’s pop this beast open and find out what it has to offer Pours completely pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing The nose is very bold, and surprisingly not even that boozy. I’m picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, vanilla bean, molasses, toasted oak, brown sugar, sweet bourbon, light roast coffee, burnt caramel, black cherry, and light leather The complexity is dialed back in taste in favor of something more bourbon-forward, but it’s still damn good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet bourbon, raisin, dark chocolate, molasses, charred oak, vanilla bean, black cherry, light brown sugar, and cinnamon. The swallow brings notes of charred iak, sweet bourbon, black cherry, molasses, dark chocolate, raisin, smoky tobacco, and vanilla bean A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer.

No foam whatsoever. No surprise there. There is a creamy appearance to it though. Like chocolate milk towards the center with more light penetration on the outer edges. Nose is straight up strong bourbon and oak against a huge roasted malt backdrop. Ethanol is defintely showing itself. Chocolate is prevalent here as well. Sweet confection, like a rich caramel, interacts with the chocolate and brightens it up. On the palate, we've got that huge bourbon for sure. Oak tannins are strong on this one. That chocolate shows up but gets overshadowed by both barrel influence and roasted malt. Some savory notes permeate this brew. This aspect always reminds me of well done street cart pretzels. On the back end there is a beautiful dark chocolate covered coffee bean note that lingers for quite some time. Mouthfeel brings heat not only from the ABV but the tannins as well. Hot and drying. Probably would be better off drinking this in the dead of winter, but alas, here I am in the dog days of summer. Overall, while I very much enjoyed this brew, the time its taken me to snag this bottle combined with the ever rising prices of, well everything, this one didn't quite live up to the reputation placed upon it. Perhaps I should have aged this one a little longer. Anyway, despite that, great brew, but other breweries do great things that are similar and less costly and even more available.

Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a fizzy, one finger light khaki head that quickly dissipates to sparse patches with slight lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, bourbon, dry caramel, chocolate; boozy. Flavor is bourbon, dark toasted malt, bakers chocolate, raisins, dry caramel, oaky vanilla and a touch of licorice. Hot boozy bourbon finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and sharp carbonation. I've tried a lot of bourbon barrel stouts in my day, and this is the most bourbon forward that I can remember; almost like a bourbon boilermaker that was extra heavy on the whiskey. Fortunately, there is a lot of flavor in the base too, with good chocolate and oak, some dark fruit and caramel that are more reminiscent of a blended strong ale. I was concerned with the fizzy pour, but despite the quick fade of the head, there is plenty of carbonation. There is a lot of intense flavor at the start of the taste, but the bourbon alcohol kicks in and dominates the finish; nice oak and bourbon in the lingering finish. The two years this can has on it has not seemed to mellow the flavor much (and if it has, glad I got an aged one). I expected a big, boozy stout and this delivered. It is a bit on the unbalanced side from the barrel effect, but enjoyable. I'm glad about the sensible 16oz. can over the traditional The Bruery 750s. Glad I had a chance to taste this classic.

Poured a hit into a logoed Cigar City taster’s glass. Little spritz of head doesn’t last at all. Smell is bourbon heavy chocolate, vanilla bean pod, prunes, vapor of alcohol. Taste threw me back a step with a full assault of molasses, creme de cacao, dark malt, coffee and oak barrel.,. then the 19% ABV let me know who the boss is. Feel is mighty mighty and thick. Tounge tar. Rich as Musk. Low carb. Overall, Damn. I stood there and refilled my 4 ounce taster’s glass couple of times more and had to go sit down. Drink some agua. Serious barrel aged Big Stout.,.

There could be many reasons for my accolades, but two stand out. First, this Wild is a controlled Wild. Not many Wilds do that because not many micros have worked at controlling Wilds. Second, Beatification's flavors met and melded with the food; which in this case was RR's pizza. But I suspect this Wild would have done well with many foods because it was mild, yet alive without an infused yeast. This is what Lambics do. And this is what RR has achieved in Beatification and  their many other Wilds that I have not tried.... but probably now should. Jun 26, 2025 Report",4.27

There's a pleasant mineral note as well.  On the finish there's more minerals and white wine, lingering sourness, oak, and slight chalky yeast with a touch more funk. M:  This beer has a body which is on the lighter side of medium.  Carbonation is light and soft, but it's to be expected given the age and corkage.  The acidity ensures that this beer has a drying finish. O:  Overall this is a phenomenal beer that has held up incredibly well to the test of time.  I'm quite shocked at the level of acidity that this one still brings to bear as most sours I've had around this age have been lacking in acidity.  Truly incredible. Mar 24, 2025 Report",

Bottled just about two years ago, which isn't too long in wild ale years, but I was surprised to find that whatever intended refermentation in the bottle didn't really seem to have worked out. The beer poured almost still with a distinct pee color. Barnyard-forward funky aromas -- hay, horse, must, herbal hop, and a bit of apricot. Taste has a good amount of that crushed aspirin bitterness alongside lemon, wheat, grapefruit juice, wildflower honey, and chardonnay grapes. Pleasant but fairly boilerplate spontaneous ale. Feel is not great due to the fermentation issues -- only the lightest of discernible effervescence. Overall a bit of a let down, but maybe it's just a bad bottle < 60/100 Jan 05, 2024 Report",2.85

Beatification,"Reviewed by kemoarps from New York 4.17 /5 rDev -8.1% look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 Sent my way as return fire by @Beersnake1 during NBS BIF#16. Pours a pure golden yellow that's mostly clear, but I wouldn't describe as crisp. The colour, actually, isn't far off from a slightly lighter version of the label. Wet bubbles rise through the liquid, but there's no head, and thus nothing to retain nor leave lacing. Nose is bright and inviting. Starts off much more on the fruity side rather than the truly funky side (we're getting there, though, don't worry!) with some apple, and like meyer lemon. The apple transitions to a mustiness that gives rise to thoughts of wood, and carries us over to the earthier funkier side with light elements of barnyard and just a kind of tart element. Flavour is awash with an interesting lead in that I want to give credit again to that meyer lemon-type flavour, then bits of crabapple and wood giving way to the earthy funk again, which presents in a really interesting way that I can only think to describe as, 'open.' I don't know how that works, but where a lot of funky wild ales like this feel tight, compressed, bound up tartness, this feels like the pages spread wide and a more easygoing (but no less pronounced) welcoming earthy funk. The lemon and the funk kind of build together to a pinnacle about 2/3 of the way through that is more in the horse blanket realm and borders on harsh, though the rest of it feels aggressively tart, but in a welcoming manner. The back end takes elements from all of the above, along with a little bit of bleu cheese and faint honey to leave a tart dry finish. Very fine carbonation sits atop a decidedly funky/tart beer, but one that I wouldn't describe as sharp. I've had several in the -ation series, and they've all been top notch. This is no exception.

It brought me back to my first pilgrimage to RRBC in Santa Rosa at the 4th Street location. I thought I was there for the IPAs but a family member ran into someone they knew with a goblet of another RRBC barrel-aged product who said ""I don't even like beer but I love this!"" I ordered my own goblets and was introduced to the loveliness of Sanctification and Consecration. So began my love affair with RRBC barrel-aged stuff. The 100th percentile score is well-earned. This is a delicious sour, which offers common ground to people who normally will not drink sours. The more sophisticated reviews for this will fill in all the notes of stonefruit and granny smith apple stuff that my review lacks; all I have to say is, in the same way that you could serve PtE to someone who would never touch a DIPA with a ten-foot pole, a goblet of this can evangelize regular folks with unsophisticated palates like mine to appreciate the wonder of wild ales and sours made by skilled people.

Living where I do, getting any beer worthy of writing home is difficult. I saw a bunch of Russian River's wild ales, I knew they had to come home with me. This is a sour beer aged in wine barrels. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a frothy white one-fingered head. The retention lasted maybe 15 seconds, leaving no lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 6, golden with amber hues. The beer is somewhat clear with a load of carbonation bubbles. Initial aromas in the beer are wine, funky barn, straw, damp earth, and lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, horse blanket, oak, a hint of floral, and a touch of herbal. The flavors in the beer are lemons, chardonnay, funky barn, horse blankets, straw, wheat, toasted crackers, a touch of apple cider, herbal, floral, and champagne-like flavor. The mouthfeel of the beer is tart, tannic, and bright. The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish. The beer has this explosion of sourness and funk. The wine barrel aging comes through pleasantly taking the edge off the sourness. I not sure if this my favorite offering from Russian River. This beer is a solid example of a wild ale, but I will not drink it again. Jun 15, 2021 Report",4.19

Orange-honey color, I'd call it highly hazy or cloudy in appearance, but not truly opaque like some NEIPAs. Thick, creamy looking head, colored somewhere between off-white and beige. Lots of lace and sticky globs of foam adhered to the sides of my teku as said head dropped. Aroma is reminiscent of tropical fruits, melons, stonefruits and grapefruit. Big hoppy nose to this, in a way that straddles the NEIPA and WCIPA styles. Curious to see if the beer's hoppiness is as dramatic in the taste. Up front, it's actually a little less intense than I was expecting. It's definitely a fruit forward beer in terms of the flavor hitting the taste bud beachhead, but it's a bit more restrained. At the finish it is sharply bitter, almost grassy and quite dry. This sharp dryness seemed to mellow as it warmed a little after opening. Soft, slightly creamy mouth feel.

Alter Ego,"Reviewed by unlikelyspiderperson from California 4.12 /5 rDev -9.3% look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4 Nice beer overall, balances the fruit salad (emphasis on strawberry and maybe blueberries for me, along with the general tropical vibe) aroma and flavor with a nice hit of bitterness. There's a nice strawberry flavor that is pretty unique in my experience that I could see really appealing to some people. Pours a deep orange, opaque hazy brew that veers toward the ""turbid"".  Huge dense foam head with a light khaki color. Aroma is incredibly loud, sweet orange, strawberry, pineapple/mango/nectarine, just an absolute fruit salad. Really pleasant Taste is bitter at first (probably just jarring compared to the aroma) with citrus pith hitting hard. Then it widens out to a soft, berry forward fruitiness. Nice bitter finish that lingers pleasantly. A little watery all in all. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft but a little thin. Nov 08, 2022 Report",4.12

Sampled on 05/17/22 $15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22 Notes via stream of consciousness: The label states that this is the ""twin brother to Julius"", and that it ""builds upon Julius with... Mosaic and Amarillo..."". A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far. The aroma offers upsome sweetish malt, soft berries, and orange. The flavor is fuller with additional notes of mango, passionfruit, peach, lychee, floral blossoms, grass, pine, and earth. A median bitterness balances it and along with a little bit of ""hop bite"" leads to a dry finish with some fruit, pine, earth, and spice lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. The head held up quite well and there are torn sheest of lace and craggy rings left throughout the glass. I actually like this better than Julius but that's probably just because Mosaic hops are my current favorite. Review #7,978 May 17, 2022 Report",4.44

Yet another TH beer in the top 250 as well.

I’m picking up on aromas of juicy mango, peppery hops, apricot, doughy malt, orange juice, and papaya It is similarly balanced in taste, feeling bright and juicy. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tangerine zest, crackery malt, juicy mango, earthy hops, orange juice, and peach. The swallow brings notes of peppery hops, tangerine zest, crackery malt, papaya, gooseberry, and light orange zest A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer.

An inch-tall, foamy, tan colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, frothy cap and a dense, bubbly collar. Spotty lacing blanketed the glass after every sip. The aroma was solid but not remarkable. Coffee notes came through strongest. Dark roast coffee specifically. Roasted malts were also apparent. Loads of cinnamon too. There was a subtle, sweet maple-like quality as well. Hint of vanilla. The maple intensified as the beer warmed. The flavor profile was also very roast forward. Roasted malts led things off up front. Dark roast coffee was also quite apparent. Sweet maple notes came through in the center. Cinnamon was noticeable here as well. More deep roast on the back end and in the finish. Some bitter char lingered after the swallow. The mouthfeel was super creamy and frothy but quite thin. The liquid contained an ultra fine, zippy, tongue blanketing effervescence that gave the beer a nice suppleness on the palate. Five years ago, I might have really enjoyed this beer, but my current palate found it far too roasty and bitter for my liking. Additionally, as much as I tried to appreciate it for being an imperial porter, I could not get past wanting it to be a full-bodied imperial stout. Apr 12, 2024 Report",3.93

Taste: The flavor is bold and intense, with a strong coffee profile and a noticeable alcohol warmth.

A: Beautiful cascading effect with a dark tan head that is creamy and dense, standing a true two inches. The exiting pour was coffee colored, thick and viscose as it slurps from the bottle. Strong lasting coverage. Lots of micro-bubbly activity. S: Burnt molasses, and chocolate. Dark sweet fruit, plums, sugary figs outlines. Sweet caramel and milky vanilla highlights. The maple syrup is rich and sweet, as well with evident hints of cinnamon spicing. Sweet initially, rich chocolate and marshmallow with cocoa. Things progressively move towards a smooth roastiness of cold coffee, caramel, and milky vanilla highlights. T: Sweet dark fruit, particularly figs and plums with a smooth campfire minerality for flavor. The maple syrup plays a strong and sweet role in the profile. Silty coffee and caramel, with some molasses are strong supporters. Silty coffee texture and covering with sweet caramel and roastiness teasing the tongue and inner cheeks. Sweet roasty sweetness of chocolate and coffee with vanilla and maple syrup highlights really define the flavor profile. M: Silty smooth texture on the mouthful with a equally smooth silty mouthful contribute and are equally as impressive. O: The syrup backing brings sweetness and depth, while the cinnamon spicing has a nice finishing and complimentary touch. Outstanding flavor and texture.  Everything blends so beautifully together its almost unreal. Sweet milky-vanilla with maple syrup and a silty texture leads to an outstanding drinkability that is exceptionally smooth and extraordinary. Mar 13, 2021 Report",

I was elated to see that I could buy Cantillon. I am using a tulip glass, and the serving temperature is 48 degrees. The pour created a light pinkish tan, airy one-fingered head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass or any semblance of a head on the liquid. The color is a reddish pink and clear. The appearance is what I would expect from a lambic. Nosing the beer, I detect notes of light toasted malts, grapes, vinous, terroir, funky barnyard, yeasty, musk, and acetic acid. Sipping the beer, the wine used in this lambic is vinous, jammy, light wood, earthy, and vinous. A few more swallows, I notice funky barnyard, yeasty, musk, acetic acid, lemons, light toasted malts, and light minerality. The mouthfeel is mouth puckering, finishing tart and dry. The body is light, with lots of carbonation. Final Thought: Thus far in Cantillon's journey, which is limited due to access to the beer, this is my favorite one. It sings with flavor and is anchored with a lovely balance. The wine pairs beautifully with the lambic, an outstanding beer. Sep 10, 2025 Report",4.75

Look: Cloudy cran-grape juice (not in a bad way). Smell: Typical lambic funk with some meatiness I get from some natty wines.  Blackberry, green chile. Taste: All over the place in the best way possible.  Cereal graininess, underripe berries, berry jam, lemon, and a strong salinity finishes it out. Feel: Carbonation is very gentle and is prickly enough to elevate the flavors. Overall: As someone who has shifted over to wine in the past years (but who still loves lambics of all stripes), this is the perfect marriage of beer and wine.  Would be the perfect crossover wine to bring wine lovers into the beer fold (especially if they’re fans of natural wines).  Worth the decades long wait. May 08, 2025 Report",4.94

Stored in a wine cooler at 55°F until it was uncorked. Bottled 11/07/22, consumed 04/20/25. Poured into a Spiegelau wheat beer glass. Drank a year after 2024’s Zwanze Day (wish I could claim that it was on purpose, but just an odd coincidence). A&S: As with most lambics very nice look to it. Evolving head and look. Initially, the beer is ruby red and lively with carbonation, but turns opaque deep purple. The head initially is fuzzy pink and doesn’t retain much. At most, it was a small ring and is able to be conjured by a swirl. On the second pour, it retains well in a thin layer. The aroma contains red wine (and white wine too), oak, grape must, red wine vinegar, tart cherries (later on) T&M: They said don’t drink this beer cold, and I would add even the 55°F recommended serving temperature is too high. Initially mildly tart, not very sweet. The funk comes out more in the taste than the aroma. As it warms, softer floral and fruity flavors: rose hips, tart cherries, apple skin. I have seen other people describe this beer as soft or delicate, I think that is a fitting description. Mouthfeel is pretty superb, smooth but bubbly. Light body and sneaky drinkable (I say this because initially I didn't think I would finish it so fast, and then all of a sudden it was gone). Overall: This beer almost needs to breathe like a wine does. For the price (at least $50, probably more like $65), I wouldn’t buy this one again, but it was a fun way to spend the morning drinking a beer, writing a review, and enjoying the fresh air.

Created a generous foam quantity that lasted quite a while before jumping in. S: The aroma is actually perfect without any overpowering acidity. It's balanced as it is sweet, savory, and acidic to the right point. It's a great beer only by smelling it. T: It's the taste of heaven. I think that after Fou'Foune, this might be my favorite Cantillon beer. It's perfectly balanced with the sweet notes from the grain and the grapes embracing quite well the light fruitiness, and very light bitterness of aged hops combined with just the right amount of acidity incoming from Brettanomyces.

Saint Lamvinus,"Reviewed by SierraNevallagash from Maine 4.47 /5 rDev -1.5% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5 2019 Vintage - poured into a wine stem at 45°F. Pours a bright, translucent ruby stone red, with half a finger of pinkish-white head forming, and then immediately settling to a thin collar. Simple, but very pretty. Nose: Soft grainy base, with raw wheat and dusty grain silo, beneath a very bright, vibrant fruit layer. This isn't deep, saturated, sweet grape, but young, fresh, and juicy. Some underlying jammy notes of red currant, blackberry, raspberry, peak through, with a deeper red wine note coming in and out of focus. Some gooseberry, pear, and lemon notes lend brightness and fruity acidity atop a very restrained, young funk presence, with hay, stable, leather, wet oak, petrichor, grass, and topsoil. Palate: Saint Lamvinus greets the palate with a mildly tart spark, paired perfectly with a thread of sweetness. I believe both the grain *and* the fruit are lending some sugars here. Bright, yet musty grape, with a touch of red berries, abd then the brighter notes emerge, showcasing lemon, gooseberry, white grape, and unripe stone fruit. With this, the tartness increasing, becoming fully dry, with high minerality opening the door for classic Cantillon funk - sea shells, salty air, old wet oak, hay, damp soil, and an almost brie/bloomy rind neutral musty note. Some significant oak tannins emerge, alongside a subtle, tonic-like bitterness. Tartness disappears, finishing with red wine cask, grape skin, and grapefruit pith. Mouthfeel/Body: This seems to have found its sweet spot, with 7% ABV balancing between enough grain to lend presence, but not enough to advance from the background. Delicate and fluid, but enough body to lend a softness. Effervescence is extremely fine and gentle, but still fairly fizzy. Not puckering - tartness is kept in check, and allows for a progression of dryness. Balanced tannins. Overall: A delicate, expressive, and definitively Cantillon Cantillon. The grape presence appears simple at first, but unfurls with some subtle but complex depth, pairing with just the right amount of complimentary funk. The subtle suggestion of sweetness is beautiful, and the lambic proceeds with these little ""chapters"" of flavour. Remarkably balanced and approachable, with an elegant simplicity.

It has a rich, fecund, manure scent with horse blanket and soil. At last, after seeing these descriptors attached to wine and cheese and other delicacies I can see why animal poop can be something nice on a beer's bouquet. And the beer surprises again with the first taste, and an incredibly well crafted sourness, with any excessiveness acid trimmed and leaving a brilliant profile. It hints and teases at sweetness, but falls just short, instead offering tartaric tang. Brilliance in a bottle, with a side of horse. Mar 17, 2020 Report",4.53
Society & Solitude #5,"Reviewed by BEERchitect from Kentucky 4.39 /5 rDev -3.3% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 With a blend of American and New Zealand hops, a well-engrained idea of what an imperial IPA should be. the talents at Hill Farmstead put their nose on the grindstone to develop the best taste possible from this hop medley. Society & Solitude #5 shows what's possible with the cooperation between the Pacific Northwest and the Land Downunder. The foggy golden-straw beer takes the hues of sepia and puts it in a haze-infused and unadulterated pour. Its cottony swath of foam fills the room with a tantalizing fragrance of tropical, citrus and vinous fruits that wet the whistle by scent along. Its taste is succinct with the delicacy of sugar cookie and shortcake sweetness with a nearly tart interplay. Its radiant fruit upstart soon makes way to a drying middle palate where the racy and radiant fruits come out to play- white grapefruit, branch-ripe orange, hints of lemon and white grape tease the tastebuds while the pulpy richness of under-ripened pineapple, passionfruit and kiwi round out the fruit punch and sherbet tangy-sweet flavor. Gooseberry, green tea and white wine finishes the session with those unapologetic urges of hemp, chive, verbena and earthy geranium. Fuller in body, the beer's firm and smoothly bitter grip on the throat is balanced and bitter-sweet. Its soft resinous power of fresh spruce turns to lemongrass and fresh grass clippings before trailing with a dank and tart fruit aftertaste. Oct 17, 2023 Report",4.39

Mexican Brunch,"Reviewed by BEERchitect from Kentucky 4.24 /5 rDev -6.8% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter. Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions. As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste. Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino.

Did get a nice coconut smell and taste but think the time on the bottle probably muted both of those a bit.  The thing I didn't like as much was the roasty taste, which I guess might be the porter part, but could also be some darker coffee roasts.  And no hint of alcohol or barrel at all - this would have help for me.  So be it, my opinion.

Thin ring of foam is left along the outside of the glass. Aroma is predominately coconut - a bit suntan lotion-y - but still decent. Hints of cocoa. Its rather one note with the coconut being predominate on the nose. Also very sweet - you can just smell the sweetness here. Taste follows the nose with strong notes of coconut up front. Underneath this, there are notes of roasted malts, chocolate, and vanilla. Not much in the way of barrel presence or bourbon. Feel is semi-thick pretty slick and oily. Mild carbonation. Semi-dry finish. Overall its a nice beer - to me the coconut is far too predominant - especially in a barrel aged beer. Nov 17, 2019 Report",3.97

Last Buffalo In The Park,"Reviewed by Harrison8 from Missouri 4.47 /5 rDev -1.5% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5 Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is big, bold coconut right at the forefront. Vanilla bean quickly follows coconut. What happens next is a mixture of gift shop fudge, toffee and coffee and hearty stout malts, with notes of toffee, molasses, caramel, coffee and roasty, toasty, caramely malts charging through. There is a very light whiskey heat on the edge, but it melds into the background well. Flavor profile continues to push the coconut heavy narrative, with vanilla bean coming on second. Between the two, the onset is very sugary. The remainder of the flavor profile works its way back towards balanced by order of notes of toffee, caramel, molasses, coffee, and roasty, toasty malts. Whiskey starts to come on at the end to boil away some of the sugar. Whiskey melds in well, never coming off as hot or out of place. Mouth feel is thick with a grainy velvety texture that feels decadent each and every sip. Overall, boisterous with a lot going on, with coconut and vanilla bean at the helm.

It forms a thin crown of bubbles that are khaki in color and dissipate quickly. 3.75 The nose carries a stinging bourbon before even putting my nose to it. Putting my nose into it brings it with a more toned definition. There is freshly cut coconut mixing with brown sugar and that warming bourbon with a kiss of dark fruit. They achieved a very natural coconut; no suntan lotion smell. 4.75 The taste brings in the brown sugar just tangling with freshly toasted coconut all the way through. Slight milk chocolate, but just as an accent. It’s almost like a coconut pie drizzled with some chocolate. The bourbon is there with some dark fruit accents, but they didn’t let this stray too far away from what the base is. 4.5 The mouthfeel is smooth and doesn’t have a bourbon burn to it, just a nice, balanced warmness to let you know it’s there along with a dryness from the barrels. I would call it medium bodied. 4.5 Overall, this didn’t stray far from the base at all (despite the almost double ABV) but did add a new dimension to it with a few nice layers. After having this and Morning Wood last week it makes me wonder how long they age these in barrels. I would guess minimal aging (3-5 months) just because the way they are more accenting than anything. Which isn’t a bad thing to me, but just doesn’t morph the beer like you’d guess.  4.5 May 12, 2019 Report",4.52

These guys seem to make some of the most strongly smelling dark beers that I have ever had. Big notes of coffee, chocolate, and spices. The drinking starts smooth and silky upfront with tons of lush chocolate malts. A smooth flow that finishes ever so slightly bitter. The coffee falls on the subtle side but the highlight flavor is clearly the coconut. I love coconut and the flavor comes off spot on genuine. Additional notes of tannin, smoke, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, cocoa powder, and smoke. The mouth feel is superb- full bodied with such a lush and silky feel. Not overly sweet and not terribly sticky but enough to still allow the flavors to linger nicely after each sip. A slight alcohol burn on the finish but otherwise the abv hides very well and it's really warming me up. Overall, just crazy good stuff. May 10, 2019 Report",4.57

Flavors of bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, light oak.  Certainly smooth for the ABV, a very good full body, appropriately carbonated.

Gift to me by @2beerdogs in a face-to-face meetup which inevitably included an exchange of beer. Pours dark brown, surprisingly not tarry black, with basically zero head on the pour. Nothing emerges afterward, either (which sometimes happens with huge stouts, in my experience). Smell is booze and chocolate. Searching around, I might get a little bit of charred oak and burnt coffee. Taste is rich, rich chocolate. Booze is noticeable outgassing through the sinuses more than in the flavor itself, which is interesting. I get more toffee and vanilla in the flavor than I would have guessed from the aroma. Maybe some black licorice...but if so, it's fairly subtle. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light...not to say it's light, it's just not dark matter like I would expect from the style, the brewery, and the abv. Very still, but not offputting. Overall, this is a very good ginormous stout that has stood up to a decade in the bottle quite well. May 26, 2024 Report",

In addition to heavy booze (via bourbon) is chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, coffee and roasty, toasty malts. There is a hint of char at the finish. Flavor profile follows suit, with sugary notes of chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, caramel and brown sugar mingling with lightly bitter notes of roasty, toasty malts, coffee and char. Booze and bourbon is present throughout, adding a substantial level of heat even after aging the bottle for a couple years. Alcohol turns the finish to dry, rinsing away the initial sweetness.

Aroma brings a soft touch of molasses upfront, carrying soft caramel creams into a steadily building oaky vanilla and eventually culminating with robust waves of raw cacao meeting oaky bourbon. Taste opens with bittersweet cocoa tinged with toasted oak barrel and residual bourbon characteristics, though the malt is central, peaking over the mid-palate with the purest, flaky roast sensations cooly revealing layer upon layer of oily, raw cacao, burnt almond, and evocative dark chocolate. Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body, silkily textured and, in tune with a soft, prickly carbonation, sporting mild gritty accents into the mid-palate; suggestions of distant char and balanced booziness enhance over the back end, eventually leveling out to a dry roast along the palate's finish. Chocolate, malted chocolate, dragged from the most evocative expanses of its malt profile and kissed with a softly integrated bourbon implicating a doting heat to further accentuate the already resonant roast; a classic sipper, its quintessence on full display.

There's a big barrel character - oak char, vanilla, spicy bourbon - it feels like something that was in barrels a decently long time. There's some dark fruit and lots of dark chocolate, along with a cigar-like bitterness. This is medium bodied, not quite as thin as most Central Waters, with a *slightly* prickly carbonation to it. If the carbonation was dropped a smidgen, the mouthfeel would be much better. There's a lot to love about this one - it's a good idea to revisit what barrel aged stouts used to be.

Black Gold,"Reviewed by BEERchitect from Kentucky 4.4 /5 rDev -3.1% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Striking gold isn't easy. Once you find it once, you gotta keep going back time after time. And that's what Central Waters Brewing does with their bourbon barrel aged American Double Stout. Except, its black gold. And the beer of that exact namesake pours with the consistency of used motor oil, black and inky upon the pour, a patient froth begins to release. The draw of caramelized char, coffee, chocolate, nuttiness and wonderfully burnt cream is too much for the nose to resist. In similar form the initial taste is lush with molasses, brown sugar and cream in suggestive of roasted marshmallows. As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a strong sense of coffee, cocoa and roasted walnut overcomes the sweetness and begins to usher in the bourbon complexities with charred oak, vanilla, coconut, cherry and caramelized whisky spice. Trending moderately bitter, the late palate highlights a walnut character with coffee-like bitterness although all are probably hop-derived. Full bodied and quite decadent overall, the rich and chewy ale never promotes cloying textures, but finishes long and fat with malt flavor and mouthfeel. An extended warmth of peppery whisky and a simmering bourbon heat resonates slightly past the char and the beer's nearly port-like fruitiness. Dec 28, 2020 Report",

Yet another beer from my trade with merpunk1. This one is the highest rated Fruited Kettle Sour on BA, though it’s brewed more in the Berliner Weisse style, but whatever. It’s also currently sitting at #105 overall here, but I’m sure that’ll change soon given all the site updates as of late. Let’s pop this open Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing I really like what the guava does to this one in the nose, adding a nice funk. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe mango, funky guava, lemon juice, crackery malt, and light passion fruit It’s even better in taste, still feeling unique in a world where this kind of thing is quite common. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon juice, funky guava, mango sorbet, crackery malt, passion fruit, and light orange juice. The swallow brings notes of tart passion fruit, orange juice, tart guava, apple skin, and pineapple A light medium body pairs with aggressive tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and brisk beer. Finishes mostly dry and very tart This is really good stuff, definitely worth trading for. I gotta get my hands on more of these J. Wakefield Berliners Jan 02, 2022 Report",4.33

This smells like lemon, lactic acid, sweet mango, guava, passionfruit, and citrusy funk. This was probably earth shattering 5-6 years ago, when nothing like this existed. As it exists now, it's just a pleasantly tart fruited berliner with a semi-restrained fruit character, at least compared with the smoothie overload most breweries are doing these days. It's very drinkable, and you could easily see taking down a whole bottle of it if you so needed to. This is light bodied, crisp, clean, and pleasantly sour on the finish, with a very nice drinkability. This is most certainly overhyped, but it's still a well done and enjoyable beer through and through. Dec 14, 2021 Report",4.24

Pours black, 1/3"" brown head.  Aroma reveals that both the coffee and maple have melded/faded into the bourbon notes.  I like that sweet spot where things gel more than being led by one dominant aspect generally.  Equal parts. Taste, oh shit, now we're about to get heavenly up in here.  This is why sometimes you ignore that ""drink fresh"" notion.  Fresh maple dominates seeming too sweet sometimes, fresh coffee just dominates and that is largely all you taste.  But here, 4 years later, you get this full fledged bourbon accentuated with maple and coffee.  Again, the notion of equal parts, but it tastes even better than it smells.  Of course the damn mouth feel is silky and luxurious, the maple seems to be best here, smoothing out double digit abv into a delight to drink, never oppressive, hot, bitter etc. . .

A fluffy, two-plus finger tall, bone white crown rose above the body, but it quickly fizzled away. A small collar encircled the liquid. There was no lacing whatsoever. The aroma was outstanding. Bretty and tart. Moderately funky. Dry and oaky. Hay like. Fuzzy peach notes were detectable. Hint of sweetness. There was an interesting, bright floral quality as well. As the beer sat, both the peach and the floral notes mellowed and the funk intensified. The acidity increased as well, and the nose took on a white vinegar-like quality. The flavor profile was solid but harsher and less complex than the aroma. Super tart and bretty up front. Lemony. Musty, funky, barnyard-like notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate. Lots of dry, oaky barrel as well. A surprising amount of earthy hops were noticeable in the center. More oaky barrel, lemon and earthy hops on the back end and the finish. The hops and some pithy, acidic, lemon rind-like notes lingered long after the swallow. The mouthfeel was definitely the most impressive aspect of the beer. It was medium bodied but incredibly effervescent. The bubbles were large but tight and intense, like a fine champagne. Even though the peach was pretty subtle and the cognac barrel aging was lost on me, this beer was still really complex and enjoyable. That said, due to the intense tartness, I am glad it came in a small format bottle. Oct 23, 2024 Report",

Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar.

A dulce de leche, sort of caramelized milk and vanilla character comes forward with the coffee as the beer sits. There’s an oily, prickly tingle throughout which is as much a taste as a feel.

Every beer I have consumed thus far has been blown my expectations away. My first stout from Tree House; when  I opened the can, a heavy coffee aroma emitted. I poured the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass. The pour created a creamy and foamy dark brown two-fingered head with excellent retention. The color charts around SRM 26, dark brown like used motor oil without the highlights. Coffee is strong and present with the initial nosing. Dark roasted malts, toffee, molasses, a hint of smoke, a touch of char, and tobacco. The smell is dominated by the fragrant coffee aromas. One of the strongest coffee-flavored beers next to Oliphant Brewing Coffee Ale. The molasses, caramel, and toffee tempering out the bitterness. This created velvety coffee flavors.  The dark roasted malts give some char, bready, and earthiness to the beer. I detect The mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and bold. The body is heavy, has low carbonation, and has a robust finish. The coffee flavors in the beer are rich and flavorful. One of the best coffee beers I have consumed in a long time. A must-try for any coffee stout lover. Oct 09, 2021 Report",

This is one of those beers you just have to try at least once, so here I go! Pint can - dated 01/14/20 - poured into a tumbler at 50°F. Pours a gleaming jet black - no head, until a two finger coffee bean-coloured head races up, before racing right back down to a still top, looking like tar in the glass. Like nothing I've ever seen. I'll give a 5 to that. Nose: Black coffee. Some roasty nuance, such as a hint of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and even a hint of dark fruit and red wine, but this is essentially sweet coffee. Palate: Much like the nose, this is an absolute coffee bomb. It opens up quite sweet, with lots of cocoa from the roast, which lends its own coffee character as well. Moderate roast, accentuated by the coffee, but the hearty sweetness wins over. Secondary notes of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and unfortunately, lactose. I knew there was something unpleasant about this - there's clearly lactose in it. The lactose lends this quick spike of this almost aspartame/artificial sweetener flavour just before the finish, where it also extinguishes any sort of roast that may have been. Luckily, there's enough coffee for the more roasty notes of the bean to come through in the finish, which helps to dry it out. Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is full-bodied, and has a slick, oily feel to it. In addition to the naturally full body, the lactose definitely adds,some viscosity here, as does the sheer level of sweetness. Major stickiness is left clinging to the lips with this one. Effervescence is actually quite adequate - lower, but very fine and fizzy. Overall: All the components of a great coffee stout are here. The beans themself are clearly primo quality, with zero green pepper or stale notes, the base stout is well-crafted, but - it's too sweet, and there's just too much lactose. In fact, if there weren't any lactose, i think it could pull off the sweetness just fine, but with both elements in place, it does become a bit cloying. I do not think the lactose benefits this beer in any way whatsoever. You can easily get that chewy feel without milk sugar, and it ends up tasting more natural. It's still good, it's still drinkable, but I'd either like to see this tamed by a bourbon barrel, or just lose the lactose all together. May 28, 2020 Report",4.05

Very Green is probably my most favorite beer I’ve ever had. The flavors, the aroma, all of it. This is every bit what Very Green was from what I remember. I can’t say if it’s more flavorful or not, I just don’t have the reference point. All that being said, hot damn I love this beer. So dynamic. Juice slams you in face on the initial sip and then it fades to a piney after taste. You really kinda hit both NEIPA and West Coast styles all in one sip. Their is a slight difference when drank from the can and a glass. The can lip seems to fizz up the beer and almost hides some of that juice at the start. From the glass it’s so pronounced and smooth. The “green” beers are heaven, and the TreeHouse concept of “maxing them out” is a wonderful idea. It’s like heavy legs day at the gym. How much can I really do?

Nose is mostly tropical - papaya and passionfruit juice, along with spent grain. A hint of spicy alcohol as well as it warms. Initially, the taste answers the question of what adding more Sunny D to a glass of Sunny D would taste like. The answer is Sunny D. It's OJ without the tartness, sweet yet somehow watered down at the same time. Flat, one-note sweetness. On the finish, however, it does develop some - hints of hop spice, a little resin here, a little pine there. White and black pepper. Mouthfeel, however, is pleasantly soft and full. Was hoping for more resinous punch here given the reviews, but any ""greenness"" takes a backseat. Feb 15, 2022 Report",4.04

Zesty orange, creamy tangerine, mango, slightly sweet gritty grain note (in a great way), and a fine line between juicy and a gentle bitterness.

Gggreennn!,"Reviewed by Roguer from Connecticut 4.45 /5 rDev -2% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Hazy, opaque, pulpy; it's a classic Tree House IPA, along with excellent head production and lacing, and nice retention. Body is right between lemon-yellow and orange. Would it surprise you to hear that this beer is, well, hoppy on the nose? Very bright and fresh: orange, tangerine, mango, and bright green herbs. Absolutely bursting. Reminds me of classic TG hop bombs, but without any of the dirtiness. A touch lighter on the palate than the hops on the nose implied. Pineapple, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit peel (primarily on the finish), mango. Smooth and creamy on the palate, although not quite as full bodied as some of their other IPAs. Consistent with their brand, there is plenty of bitterness alongside the bursting juiciness, along with a bright and semi-dry finish, really readying you for the next sip. No hop burn or astringency. Tree House are among the leaders of the NE IPA sub-style for a reason. They hop these beers to high heaven in all phases, yet always avoid any burn. The hops are juicy and fruity, but they resist the urge to stick to late- and dry-hopping, completely avoiding the 0-IBU race. The mouthfeel is always smooth and creamy, evoking the Vermont masters who first stood out in that fashion. The result: incredible consistency; juicy, drinkable beers that are still identifiable as IPAs (or as beers, period, in this modern landscape); IPAs that, no matter how many you've had, never fail to impress and deliver.

Finally grabbed one on a recent trip to Chicago. From what I can tell, it's the 2022 vintage (late 2022) and it's the last time this was bottled? So a bit over 2 years old at this point, but it's coming in hot! Coffee a little muted on the nose, but still there in the taste. Huge bourbon and booze finish. Excellent mouthfeel that coats your tongue. I really miss the FW beers. They've really kept up the quality, unlike a lot of local BA beers in my market from Founder's or Bell's. This one is fantastic. Recommendation: Another classic from FW that's still in the Top 250. Doesn't look like it's bottled every year, so get it if you see it! Jun 30, 2025 Report",4.64

Bittersweet and almost but never quite smokey/spicy. Mild bitterness throughout, earthy/woodsy medium-dry finish with hints of black tea and bourbon. Slippery, almost oily mouth-feel, with some residual tannins.

I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nib, earthy hops, roasted espresso, molasses, burnt toast, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and tobacco It trends much more bitter in taste, but that underlying sweetness helps things from getting out of hand. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, earthy hops, cacao nib, dark roast coffee, plum, rye toast, burnt caramel, light vanilla, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of cacao nib, dark roast coffee, burnt toast, toasted oak, black cherry, caramel, earthy hops, light plum, and molasses A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer.

OA, I enjoy these annually because they’re really good. Feb 01, 2025 Report",4.44
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by russpowell from Arkansas 4.31 /5 rDev -4.6% look: 2 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Canned version.  Pours an effervescent chestnut/mahogany with one finger of rapidly falling mocha colored head.  No head retention or lacing S:  Some barrel notes, coffee, some brown sugar notes once warmed up, plus vanilla.  Sort of tails off as it warms T:  Follows the nose, oaky dryness, dark chocolate, hints of vanilla & leafy hops, roastyness as well up front.  More coffee, Baker's Chocolate, oaky dryness& a little bit of booze smack as this beer warms up, coconut also asserts itself & just a little bit of barrel twang.  Finishes with plenty of coffee, dark chocolate, plus good amounts of coconut, vanilla & barrel & a little leafy hop MF:  Medium body, restrained carbonation, warming & a little sticky This is about as coffee forward as you can get on a BA Imp Stout for me to really enjoy it, all flavors are in harmony.  A bit of a sipper to be sure.  I do wonder if this is better from the bottle.  If everything was as good as the flavor A++ Just an A/A+ instead Aug 17, 2024 Report",4.31

Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by Roguer from Connecticut 4.32 /5 rDev -4.4% look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5 Very good head production, but retention is lacking, fading to only the thinnest possible ring around the rim of the glass before long. Body is a lovely obsidian hue, cola-like along the edges. Aroma is quite strong, prominently featuring the bourbon. Notes of bourbon mash, brown sugar, oak, leather, red grape, cherry, coconut, syrup. Flavor absolutely delivers on a classic, BCBS-like BBA imperial stout. Lots of bourbon, but not overpowering; moderate char; bitter, but not overly hoppy nor too roasty, coming across on the more restrained side of RIS. Toffee, ginger cookies, raisin, coffee, prune, bourbon, oak, leather, white pepper, blackstrap molasses. Exceptionally easy to sip, savor, and chew, despite the ABV and barrel influence. Does finish fairly hot on the back third, letting you know just how big it is. This is an excellent BA RIS, with tons of complexity and an admirable restraint on all fronts. It's supremely drinkable, and less rich than most others, without sacrificing flavor. That said, I personally wish it delivered more richness along with that complexity, perhaps just a touch more sweetness and thickness. I also favor AIS over RIS, which certainly influences my take on this one. Mar 01, 2023 Report",4.32

Stored at 34 degrees at home. Received from @Whyteboar in NBW BIF #16.  Reviewed 05/12/22.  Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Undated can.  Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  The final temperature was 57.7 degrees. Appearance – 3.5. First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear. Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque.  Under direct light, same.  When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – bottom edge ruby, top edge olive. Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), buff, high density with a few surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.1 – 0.15 cm crown and a thin island. Lacing – None.  Not much expected at 11% ABV. Aroma – 4.25 – Chocolate, weak char, and some hints of bourbon.  No hops, no yeast. Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Bourbon not detected.  Slight oakiness.  No hops or yeast.  No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste.  Moderate gastric warming occurs.  No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Palate – 4 – Medium, dry side of creamy, soft but lively carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Look unremarkable, pretty much like every other high ABV RIS or Impy stout.  Aroma is fairly typical but has a char note that many lack and lacks the coffee notes that many have.  Bourbon is present on the nose but seems absent in the taste.  The taste also has both chocolate and char as well as an oakiness from vanillin but lacks the tannin notes.  As the temperature reaches the end, some bourbon notes finally appear.  Overall, a good RIS that’s certainly more subtle than most. Dec 05, 2022 Report",4.23

Pours almost black; creamy khaki head that fades leaving solid retention and lacing. The aromas are malt forward. Hints of chocolate and cocoa. Some cherries and dark fruits. Mild hints of vanilla. The bourbon is pretty subtle in the aroma department and almost goes unnoticed. The flavors are balanced. More chocolate leading the way. More hints of vanilla coming from the oak. More cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins too. Some molasses. Subtle spiciness. Possibly some hints of rye and black pepper in the mix. The bourbon is subtle but noticeable and blends well with everything. Subtle sweetness. Low bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Subtle alcohol flavors in the finish along with an enjoyable warmth, but it's not hot or boozy at all. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy, velvety, creamy and smooth. This is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. It's subtle and bold at the same time. I always liked Plead The 5th, but never tried the barrel-aged version so I'm glad to have finally tried it after all of these years. It's simply enjoyable and fun to drink. Not bad at all. I like it.

Ordered a crowler of this from Growler Guys in Portland, Oregon. The main thing that stuck out to me about this beer was its sweetness. It was weird. It was simultaneously one of the dryest & sweetest triple IPA’s i had ever tasted. It didn’t have the malty sweetness of a barley wine, but instead had this intense sweetness on the finish.

Pours a pale golden color with a frothy white head, sudsy lace. Aroma is monstrous tropical citrus along with dank sticky resinous pine. Yes. Smells like rubbing a handful of hop cones together. The beer hits the palate hard with an unapologetic bitter hop bite, resinous and chewy. Behind that are copious hop oils and alpha acids that give off an explosion of citrus flavors—grapefruit mostly, like licking the inside of the rind. Definitely an underlying layer of pale malt sweetness too, like peaches maybe a day past peak ripeness. Finishes again with a tingling sharp hop bite. Bold and assertive, but still balanced. This contains 11.5% alcohol? Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied, sticky, chewy. Nice warming finish. Overall a truly lovely beer—not subtle or nuanced—but wonderful all the same.

The beer pours a orange and amber color, golden hues when hit by the light and a firm finger of white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a few spots of soapy lacing. The aroma is very good, super resinous, lots of citrus peel, lightly floral, more on the dank side of things with a strong sticky sweet malt backbone, assertive and boozy. The flavors are great, bitter and resinous pine, dank floral and grassy qualities, lots of citrus peel that offers some tropical fruits but ultimately more bitterness and a heart malt backbone, strong caramel and amber malts with some softer cereal grains and a warm booze character. The mouthfeel is good, sticky, coating, medium bodied with a good liveliness to it and finishes with a big dry kick and a warm boozy bite. Verdict: A very good west coast IPA from Boneyard. Classic in style, bold, brash, just a massive IPA, certainly boozy but with an oddly nice balance. West Coast through and through, just a massive IPA. Jun 07, 2019 Report",4.24

This is really quite good. I'm a coconut fiend, and this doesn't disappoint It's essentially liquid dessert - milk chocolate coconut. To me, it's sweet but not diabetic sweet. It's less sweet than Coconut Vibes (Shared, aka side project), but it's also less coconut forward. Coconut vibes is also liquid milk chocoluate coconut, but it has a noticeable coconut pop. This is so integrated that the coconut is integrated, but not popping. I'd prefer the popping, but this is way easier to drink than that. If I was only going to buy 1, I'd probably buy coconut vibes only because of that noticeable coconut pop. GOD i love coconut. Jan 23, 2023 Report",4.37

This smells like pure sugar, cheap melted chocolate milkshake, coconut syrup, and caramel. This is actually disgusting. This series used to be some of the best barrel aged stouts in the country, but Weldwerks has just gone off the deep end with these. It’s just tastes like sweet stout glue, basically – it’s basically liquified black sugar – it’s basically…you get it, right? It’s just way too sweet and cloying, with barely any barrel. There’s not even that much coconut, it’s just way too sweet of a base – just loads of cheap overbearing chocolate character. This is too thick, and not drinkable at all, with very little carbonation. There’s not much booziness, but that’s maybe the only single kind of good thing I can say about this. What happened to you, Weldwerks? Where did you go so wrong? Jan 19, 2023 Report",2.28

Imbibed a few samples at a local beer festival this spring & happy to finally have it from a bottle on my comfortable couch. Split with my stout-guzzling wife. Black. After a brief, wispy, half-bald head rises on the pour, it’s 100% gone two minutes later, looking still & sinister. A beer to drown your enemies in (but what a waste…maybe drown your friends?). The nose is coconut & endless malts. Medianoche – Coconut is thicker than my Sunday waffle batter. Borderline gummy chewable. Taste-wise it’s a simpler beer than I expected. I scoffed at the ‘brownie batter’ description but it’s on the mark & right up front. Well, batter with a shot of bourbon mixed in right after the eggs. Extended cut of coconut, pinch of brown sugar, serious malty sweetness throughout. Given a 10:30 AM wakeup time & a couple hours I’d love to take one of these solo. Just what I expect from this line of stouts. Thick, sweet, heavy barrel, delicious. Excellent beer. Aug 05, 2022 Report",

This looks and feels like stout gravy, I mean this is gelatinous. I can't quite decide if this is too much of a good thing or not. Does anyone else wonder if brewers add corn starch to some of these thicker beers? Weirdly, what few bubbles I could coax from a vigorous pour seemed to exist under the surface. This is massively, absurdly flavorful. I can't pick all that much out of this, just heaps of bittersweet chocolate and coconut for the most part. I do get a little bourbon but no barrel character otherwise. Very enjoyable. Edit, there was a weird 2 in long lump at the bottom of my glass. Gross, lowering some scores. Apr 06, 2022 Report",4.11

First sips are a shot of motor oil with all those flavors. The Blanton’s brings a darkness to the already heavy malt stout. There’s a tiny hint of bourbon bite, but cut by the coconut sweetness. Definitely a sipper with this viscosity. No noticeable carbonation, just still black goodness. Fortunate to have gotten this by Tavour. Honestly, Thin Man’s Recent Blanton’s BA Coconut Jenkins gives this a run for its money. Their’s is a little brighter, a little less viscous, but on par IMO. Apr 03, 2022 Report",4.98

The smell is incredible -- the bourbon barrel comes through strongly with notes of chocolate, cinnamon and coconut.

Viscous black body with a short lived brown cap.  Nose is laced with bourbon backed dark chocolate with coconut, vanilla, brownie batter, with undercurrents of molasses, roasted malt, oak, and a kiss of cinnamon.  Taste is much the same with the huge chocolate, bourbon, coconut and gourmet vanilla, but I find the coffee not being there to cut the sweetness over time hurts this one.  This is especially true in the feel, where the heavy, thick, boozy, and massive mouthfeel doesn't do anything to stop sweetness from building.

Appearance is pale cloudy hazy straw with a 2-finger rich white head that recedes slowly leaving a good amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is juicy stone fruit, peach, tangerine. Taste follows the nose with a burst of juicy goodness....peach, nectarine, wine as noted by the brewer. Picking up some honey notes, some dank, and getting a tiny bit of alcohol detection. Mouthfeel is medium. Beautifully balanced. It wants to be sweet and ever so slightly malty at the start but the balanced subtle bitterness comes thru quickly to halt any sticky sweetness. The bitterness is really nice....it isnt that chalky feeling that you can't shake from your palette from some beers....here, the sweet and bitter are fighting for balance and creating a beautiful tango of mouthfeels. This doesn't finish dry or crisp. It wants to, but I think the addition of wildflower honey prevents that. Carbonation is fluffy or pillowy. Really nice. Overall, this is fantastic! Probably the best DIPA I've had to date, imho. Everyone has a different definition of greatness based on their taste, but this one fits the bill for me. Will hunt this down again.

Breaming with vibrancy, the hop-centric beer retains a semi-sweet balance for both complexity and smoothness. The Mosaic version of Cutting Tiles pours with a heavy haze, golden matte finish, capped with a rich and creamy meringue. A strong herbal perfum is followed with tropical fruit, berry and botanicals which tease the nose while the taste is lightly pastry-like with honey, caramel and an overall angel-food malt profile. With the sweetness holding serve through the middle palate, its the fruity hop blend grows into bitterness seamlessly. Blood orange, grapefruit, mango, nectarine, apricot and cantaloup each align on the tongue with the dripping sweet and slightly acidic action of citrus fruit with other influences of blackcurrant, mint and black tea. Spruce, chive and dank herb frame a finish that circulates around the peppery bitterness of black tea, verbena, sassafras and cannabis. Nearly teeth churning and mouth-watering at the same time, the medium-full IPA carries a peppery dryness deep into aftertaste with the balancing bitter bite accompanying the spruce. But lingering sweetness keeps the fruit impressions bold and bright, crisp and clean, refreshing and tropical punch-like all at once. Mar 09, 2023 Report",4.31

Taste really follows the nose except the citrus comes first, followed by a very interesting aftertaste of malt followed by honey. Mouthfeel is great but I feel like the carbonization is a bit sharp.

This looks great. Dense haze, nice foam, and solid retention. Nose is tropical notes, pineapple and mango, peach, and grassy/piney hops. A touch of candy like quality. Sweetness. This smells great as well. Taste follows the nose. Tropical notes. Pineapple and mango. The sweet peach is here too. Juicy fruit flavors. Grass and pine are stronger. There is also this savory quality that lingers in the aftertaste. Like onion initially. But on the finish it merges with the malt backbone. Such a distinct savory finish. Really well balanced. Medium bitterness and mild hop burn, but never gets too overwhelming. Mouthfeel is smooth. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. An almost silky quality. Light and very drinkable. Overall a fantastic IPA. My introduction to Trillium and a spectacular one indeed. Sep 14, 2020 Report",4.65
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Reviewed by Taybeh from Minnesota 4.24 /5 rDev -6.2% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 At the brewery/tap room in Decorah, on tap.  Delicious and great construction/execution.  Though I’m not tasting side by side, the DDH more or less seems in line with what I wrote about the OG, so…I won’t be redundant, though maybe my palate has changed over the years, because while I think this is excellent, it doesn’t sing (nor does it seem as complex and layered) quite as brilliantly as my review of the OG records.  But that is a rather high bar. Jul 29, 2025 Report",4.24

Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Reviewed by AmeriCanadian from Tennessee 4.31 /5 rDev -4.6% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 2.75 month old can from a ""Uncaged"" Pseudo Sue mixed pack poured into a tulip. Overall take is that it's possibly a touch better on the nose than the OG, a touch lesser on the tongue (because of the little bit of starchy green bite that comes through on the dry-hopped variants, with only the Mosaic variant not experiencing that issue, at least for may palate), and in line with the other variants on the feel (i.e., slightly better than the OG).  The actual grades are basically in line with the OG and the Mosaic variant, with all of them being absolutely outstanding and just a hair better than Galaxy and Nectaron.  I'm splitting hairs with all this, as the gap is so slight across all of these Pseudo Sue beers. Regardless, this one is extremely good and hard to beat for a 6%-ish hazy APA (or even IPA). As with all my reviews of the Pseudo Sue series, really wish there was a hazy APA category to drop this into, as it's impossible to compare a beer like this to a more traditional OG APA like Zombie Dust. But this one grades outstandingly well against any kind of APA. Golden-orange, pure juice body, medium haze, more of a covering film than head, with traces of fine lacing. Fruit juice all the way. Exceptional for a hazy pale, and remarkably competitive versus larger IPAs.  Basically matches the look of OG Sue. Also like the OG, the aroma is outstanding, with huge citrus and big tropical fruit, but not the overripe, overly sweet kind. Definitely some additional mango, berry, and tangerine. Nicely dank and weedy, but not overly so. A little pine, some nice pineapple, green grape, and and red berry. Absolutely fantastic on the nose and definitely the strongest aspect of the beer. The DDH handling is certainly not hurting the product and maybe even enhancing it. Like all the others, it's incredibly drinkable and absolutely punches above its weight class on the tongue. Heavy citrus, slightly underripe tropical fruit, light berry, very grassy, solid twang of dankness, and a strong mineral note. Very dry and wonderfully pithy finish. Tons of lingering grapefruit. Largely avoids the green starchy note that hurts the Galaxy and Nectaron variants, though there's a faint trace of it at the very end of each sip.  Certainly drinks like a smaller beer with a single hop focus, but with tons of sensory delights.  As with the OG, definitely one of the best hazies I've had at this level, if not THE best. Little less thin than the OG in terms of feel, but still a little thin compared to most hazies. Then again...5.8%. Silky and smooth, with a wonderful coating quality. Slight step up from the OG with a little extra particulate and chewiness. And compared to a typical APA, it's outstanding. Outstanding and very much in line with the OG, which makes sense given the consistent Citra focus.  The OG and the DDH are largely interchangeable for me and I would never turn down either one.

Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Reviewed by wmeckley44 from Tennessee 4.85 /5 rDev +7.3% look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5 Canned 04/07/2025, into a Troegs pint glass, out of the DDH Pseudo Sue mix pack (12oz). Pours a thick yellowish orange with picturesque light foam on time. Aroma is insane, bursting with fruity mango and fresh bitter orange as well as a little vegetal dankness. Flavor follows the nose, intense ripe mango, orange peel, and juicy, bitter grapefruit. The finish has a little guava and creamy clementine ideas as well as some smooth, sweet malt, and it finishes ever so smooth and sweet. Kind of reminds me of an orange creamsicle but less sweet on the back end. There's a little vegetable matter and dankness, but the fruity bitterness and fleshy citrus flavors really take the forefront. Feel is good, not very thick and quite carbonated, with a low body. It's not sticky either and finishes mostly clean. Overall, Pseudo Sue blew my mind, and the DDH version ramps up the hoppiness to 11. I do like the maltiness and more crisp finish on the original, but the DDH version is still just as refreshing and, in my opinion, a bit more complex, which changes how I drink it a little bit. The original is a great session beer where you can pay attention to the huge flavors and interesting complexities, but you can also drink it like any American pale ale as a fantastic refreshment. DDH Pseudo Sue I enjoy more as an IPA, taking my time to let it warm and analyze the flavors as it changes. However, I did smash the first half of the can, and only wrote the longer portion of this review after getting through most of it really fast. It's that good. Wow. I have 3 more varieties in the pack to review and 11 more of these to go. I may stop buying other beers for a period now that the mixed pack is distributed in my area, and is usually quite fresh.

Mature, spicy, peppery, and lightly charred with a caramel and even spiced rum character to it.

Breakfast Stout,"Reviewed by Roy_Hobbs from Connecticut 4.15 /5 rDev -8% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 Bottled in October of 2017 I typically have trouble rating the appearance of stouts, as they all look so similar. That said, this one stands out for a robust and persistent mocha colored head that looks wonderful on top of the dark, dark brown body. Aroma has loads of coffee and rich malts. Quite nice smelling. Taste has plenty of coffee and roasted malts.  Some sweetness appears late to balance this out, but this is certainly coffee-forward (in a good way).  Full bodied and smooth. Overall, this has held up amazingly well. Perfect breakfast beer for me this December morning. Dec 21, 2024 Report",4.15
Breakfast Stout,"Reviewed by maltbeard01 from Pennsylvania 4.5 /5 rDev -0.2% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Poured room temperature from a bottle into a 16oz pint glass. Appearance is black, 2 finger khaki head. plenty of lacing on the glass. Aroma is coffee shop ambience, roasty malts, unsweetened dark chocolate. Maybe some faint hops in the distance. Taste directly follows the nose. Big flavor of a mocha java brew. Roasty malts, dark chocolate, and of course Sumatra coffee. Again, some distant hop flavor. Mouthfeel is full body, creamy, fair carbonation. Good ""chew"" to this one. Well balanced  between sweet Frappuccino and some mild bittering hops on the back end that rounds everything out. Overall this is a well-crafted classic oatmeal stout.  Very well-balanced, full bodied, smooth, creamy, and enjoyable. Almost always have a few of these on-hand, so without a doubt a must-have.

The review below is an exact copy of my original RateBeer review from 06/16/2018. 12 oz. bottle. AROMA: Scents of chocolate, coffee, and caramel. APPEARANCE: Pours an opaque black with a medium-tan head that dissipates slowly. TASTE: Medium-sweet with flavors of dark coffee, chocolate, and cream PALATE: Full-bodied, creamy texture, with average carbonation. Finish is subtle coffee bitterness that slowly wanes. OVERALL: It's dark, it's sweet, it's creamy, and it's coffee flavored! What's not to like? However, it does tend to be on the sweet side, but not quite to the point of being cloying (although, admittedly, it is walking a fine line here). If you like stouts and you like coffee, then you can't go wrong with this one. Jun 16, 2024 Report",4.03

When you get to the bottom of the glass you can see that it is clear with a brownish burgundy color. Aroma is coffee heavy, chocolate, burnt pumpernickel, caramel,  molasses and a hint of dark fruit.Taste is sweeter than the nose indicates: semisweet roast, bitter cocoa, coffee, toffee, burnt bread and dark fruit. The coffee is much less intense than in the nose. The roast is present throughout the sip intensifying in the finish it dominates the cocoa, toasty, moderately bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with low carbonation. It producers a fine peppery prickle in the finish, is lightly creamy, smooth and a pleasure to drink. Jan 12, 2024 Report",4.51

Breakfast Stout,"Reviewed by nizzle8287 from Texas 4.5 /5 rDev -0.2% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Kinda surprised that an adjunct stout has made it into the number 2 spot in the ""Oatmeal stout"" class. Anyway, poured into a pint glass at about 45f. Pours pretty extremely dark brown to black, with a khaki head that lasts for a minute or two until it recedes to a thin film and a ring that leaves nice lacing. Smells of coffee and baker's cocoa. Taste is malty chocolate forward that is dry and then the coffee hits and lingers there, ending it sort of an ashy smoky finish that resembles raw baking cocoa mixed with coffee grounds. Not sure where the ""Oatmeal"" in this oatmeal stout is supposed to have a time-slot... Kinda overwhelming on the coffee. Mouthfeel has medium carbonation, but lacks the smoothness that some other stouts have. Overall, a medium heavy beer that is very coffee forward, and I think even has a bit of caffeine in it, which I don't care too much for unless I am to wake up and drink it every morning, which I'll admit that it's Thanksgiving today and I'm staying home alone, so this beer is being served for breakfast. Pretty good brew, but I won't be buying this one all the time.. too much adjunct flavors that take it too far away from the category of simple ""Oatmeal Stout."" Nov 23, 2023 Report",

It comes with an average size tan head along with very good lacing.  Lots of coffee in the aroma but could not tell you in 100 years if it was Sumatra or Kona.  The chocolate rounds things out.  The strong coffee presence carries over to the flavor while the chocolate becomes more bittersweet.  A hint of fine tobacco near the finish.  Nuttiness adds another dimension.  Softly carbonated, full bodied mouthfeel.  This is one of those selections that can be truly  appreciated on the right occasion. Oct 22, 2023 Report",4.49

Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass.  Moderate lacing. Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here. Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick. Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too. Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully. Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced.  There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs.  This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.

Smell: Like a great NEIPA. Subtle and balanced, like a hoppy pine tree accompanied by a well proportioned waft of citrus. A mango/orange backed by hopps smell to be exact. Taste: Incredibly smooth, no burn, not pungent but a well balanced bittersweet juice taste with a strong fruity citrus that ends quickly with a smooth slight lactose bitter finish. Tail end: It leaves you knowing you just sipped a top notch beer. Quite possibly one of the best New England India Pale Ales I have ever drank. Its orange juice water in terms of smoothness.

Let’s crack if open and see what it’s all about Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing There’s a nice bite to the nose in this one, leaning a bit more traditional than they usually do. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, bready malt, peppery hops, orange zest, resin, mango juice, and light gooseberry It doesn’t quite have the same bite in taste, but I do like it quite a bit. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, white wine, gooseberry, bready malt, grassy hops, light caramel, pineapple juice, and cantaloupe. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, tangerine, gooseberry, light white wine, and overripe cantaloupe A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and dry beer.

Bursts of passion fruit, ripe pineapples and fresh cut limes, establishing an exotic fruitiness from first glance. Has a white bread dough undertone adding to the hop inspired nose, revealing additional mango, tangerine and white wine grapes. Has a soft, smooth mouthfeel to it with a fitting, complimenting carbonation. This has a lighter to medium body with a nice, refreshing effervescence during its finish. Tastes of ripe mango, luscious peaches and bitter limes, accompanied by an ice bonbon freshness and a noble hop dryness. The beer then develops an intriguing old cheese, ripe oranges interplay with a resinous peak to it, gently balanced by flowery limes and breadcrust malts. Finishes dry and bitter with a vivid fruit basket, lighter and a bit more crisp, creating a great complexity on its way out. This is quite unusual for a hazy ipa, making excessivly use of the great Nelson hop, which works marvelously well together with Citra. It‘s creating an unforseen depth which not solely relies on fruit forward flavors, but introducing a cheesy, resinous complexity, even showing off a lighter note of sweet malts. Everything in this comes together in perfect harmony, making you wish for this to last on your tongue in perpetuity. Feb 16, 2020 Report",

Pours pitch-black with two fingers of foamy, cream-colored head. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, and maple syrup. Taste follows the nose with heavy dark chocolate and coffee notes, in addition to maple sweetness.  Mouthfeel is creamy, velvety, and moderately carbonated. Finish is light lingering bitterness, some more dark chocolate that molds into sweet cream. 7.7% abv is well-hidden and this is dangerously good. Mar 19, 2025 Report",4.68

One noticeable change is that when I last reviewed this it was classified as an American barleywine and it’s now classified as English. I don’t know which is “correct” but the style classification will influence my expectations. 12oz bottle (vintage 2023) into a tulip. Pours a deep mahogany/amber with a 1-finger khaki head. Aroma is sweet and fruity with notes of vanilla, figs/dates, brown sugar, and rum-soaked pipe tobacco. Taste follows nose—sweet caramel tempered by a substantial Old World hop presence. Brown sugar, dried stone fruits, vanilla, some bourbon and oak to round things out. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, slick, lingering finish. Drinkable. Overall a solid, straightforward barleywine. Perhaps slightly hoppier than average, but highly enjoyable. _______________ Previous review (10/17/2011) preserved for posterity: 4.42/5  rDev -2% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 22oz bottle (2011 batch) poured into a snifter.

Taste follows nose. Lots of bourbon, less vanilla & oak. Alcohol is present but not overpowering. Flavors move around a bit, nice complexity. Just like w/ Parabola, a quick swirl of the snifter brings a bright flash of buttery, caramely bubbles up to the surface. Nice burst of bourbony aroma follows. Overall a really good barleywine.

A tad too bitter and dry for me to rate higher. Feel - Well carbonated and creamy, this feels great for a 12.5% beer, though slightly bitter for my liking.

Tastes much the same, with the addition of  toffee/molasses type sweetness and a touch of metallic tang. It is sweet but a clean bitter finish keeps the sweetness well in check. Medium body, low carination, smooth and soft closing with a warm alcohol bite. This has held up well.

All the earmarks of a classic big ol' barley-wine. Ablaze with all the the raisin and fig, the woody character, the deep malty, chocolatey, tobacco and leather notes. In the mouth: here's where it's all delivered, right on the palate. More big, more booze, massive malt, plenty of bourbon, vanilla, cherry, and all the deep, devilish dark fruits aplenty.

Lacing is present, but doesn't last too long. First smell that hits me is flint. (That's... odd.) Scored sugar. Roasted pecans, honey-covered. This isn't the first time I've had this brew, but I don't remember any of this. Maybe I should've downed this one and bought a fresher bottle to review because it has been one of my favorites, even if I haven't had it in years. I mean, none of this rings the ol' olfactory bell for me. Still, I rate the first bottle/can that's possible for me, so if there's wide dispersion in the quality, then it is what it is. On the taste (of this bottle), if herbal rum were a thing, this would be it, right on down to the alcohol presence. And I suppose you can kick in a little lactose, butter variety. It's much more vegetative than I remember, too. It's more bitter than most FW barrel-aged offerings. Sweetness is moderate. (There's none of the savoriness that I remember.) At least the build quality is still there. Good, fine carbonation, and there's a really pleasant woody/nutty aftertaste. Good medium-heavy weight. The overwrought alcohol presence is the only detriment. I need to revisit this one. Feb 21, 2021 Report",4.15

Something leafy and woody yet smoky, too… After an intoxicating nose, this turns into a wrestling match between three big flavors: candy sweetness, oily bean, and wood smoke. The maple is tree more so than syrup, the bacon is just smoke + salt rather than any mouth-watering savouriness, and the coffee’s just dropped out a bit. In the end the big sweetness doesn’t hang together with a whack of tannins + a couple of threads of dark roastiness. A lesson in not aging adjunct beers, but also not necessarily better than the regular strength version. Nov 28, 2023 Report",4.05

I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple, medium roast coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, smoky bacon, and burnt caramel It definitely tastes fuller, and in turn less abrasive than its base. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, light roast coffee, cocoa powder, black cherry, salty bacon, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, smoky bacon, burnt caramel, medium roast coffee, tobacco, brown sugar, and light vanilla A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer.

It smells like a fresh slice of toast, dressed and drenched by maple syrup, while a roasty, steaming cup of coffee sits just aside. Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency.

Smells of all the advertized adjuncts, foremost highlighting the beer‘s coffee, which gets even more pronounced by the sweet maple syrup, inheriting an additional blueberry quality. Has a slightly creamy, medium body with just enough finely integrated carbonation to add a refreshing note to the beer. Tastes of toasty, earthy coffee beans, entangled into melting toffee and balancing, sweet maple syrup. Turns even sweeter then, with a smoky hint of sugar glazed bacon, finding a well working antagonist in the multi facetted coffee. Finishes with a coca-cola sweetness, which overpowers everything else, even the coffee, introducing an additional note of rock sugar and no creaminess prevailing. No real complexity to be found in this, nor does the taste itself make up for the higher abv. This is mediocre at best. Dec 25, 2018 Report",3.25

The aromas lead with ground coffee, honey dipped milk chocolate and matured, spicy wood. There is a leathery quality in this, accompanied by lighter licorice and a note of caramel. Mouthfeel on this is rich, heavier bodied with a well fitting, lower level of carbonation, which manages to unfold a late effervescence. Taste offers strong notes of bitter chocolate, roasted espresso beans, dried figs and a well nuanced amount of rich sweet chestnut honey. Reveals an intriguing creaminess then with additional camp fire smoke on top, blending well into the bitter chocolate maltiness in this, together with a lighter note of caramel and  mansion dust. Finishes with a lingering herb dryness, blending well into the coffee and chocolate bitterness in this, intensified by the warming, spicy and gnarly oak of the beer.

Pours a thin mocha colored head. Beer is dense and dark. Super thick, rich, and oily legs that stick around forever. Ditto the head. Nose is sweet soy sauce, anise, prunes, other dried dark fruit, chocolate, roasted malt, and bittersweet cocoa powder. Classic RIS profile. Great complexity. Beer opens chocolate, sweet soy sauce, and semi-sweet cocoa powder. A second sip yields prunes, raisin, and anise in the front and lactose and sweet cream in the middle. Roasted malt and more dark fruit at the finish. Nothing stands out but this is perfectly balanced and the flavors complement each other completely. Body is full with low carbonation. Soft and chewy on the palate and goes down rich, silky, and subtle. Long lingering aftertaste. As with the classic whales in their respective styles, this one doesn't stand out for outrageous flavors. Instead, it stands tall for the incredible balance in both the flavor and feel. Just really a perfect beer in the style. Oct 08, 2014 Report",4.41

But when I do, it's Alexandria Whaelz. HUGE thanks to Bill A for sharing this. Drank along side the non barreled version. Bottle from 2007. A - Very dark brown, bordering on completely black. Medium tan head that lingers for awhile. I should have used a different glass, I'm an idiot. S - Not a ton going on here. A good amount of roast, some oaky vanilla notes that come in secondary. As the bottle warmed up, I got the ""Burgundy pepper"" as described below. T - Strap in. The roast is all up front until an amazing mocha blast in the mid palate. The ending is some vanilla and barrel. There is a slight earthy pepper type of thing going on during the finish. The only time I have experienced something similar is in a handful of other barrel aged beers and in aged red Burgundy's. It's awesome though. M - Rich and creamy without bogging down the beer at all. Intensely drinkable for the barrel and style and ABV. Zero alcohol on the back end. O - This was amazing. It's been one of my top wants for years and I wasn't sure I'd ever get a chance to try it. To be able to do it back to back with the regular version really showcases what the barrel does to this beer. It truly is a shame that this beer is so incredibly limited and expensive. I will forever be indebted to Bill for allowing me to try this with him! Aug 23, 2013 Report",4.59

Pours a hazed out light-medium yellow, light ring of head but solid enough streaky lacing. Nose strikes a good balance between juicier, tropical fruit (mango, passionfruit) and deeper, danker, more resinous aromas that prevent it from tilting overly tacky and sweet. Taste follows to strike a middle ground between dank and sweet with a trace of spice on the finish, all while hiding any hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is rather soft.

Gorgeous hazy.  The nose is that ubiquitous Nelson Sauvin profile, with dank passion fruit, green grapes (or white wine, if you prefer), and sweet berry aromas triggering the salivary glands. The dank passion fruit and grape flavors are forward on the taste, with the sweet berry flavors following for an exceptionally flavorful, balanced beer that drinks way too easily for an 8% ABV beer.

Poured cloudy gold orange color, fading very slowly and leaving really fine rings of foamy lacing. It smelled like ripe oranges and grapefruit ripped open, with lemon zest, tangerine and a whole array of citrus fruit rising from the glass before each sip. I had 4 over the course of a few hours and it was very smooth feeling, with spot on carbonation and a high level of bitterness that added to the taste complexities. Basically the flavor was like grapefruit juice and orange juice with hop cones floating in it; it was dank and juicy, with enough grassy hop spices and malty aspects to add balance to the citrus onslaught.

I’ve seen this one on the menu from time to time, but never manage to make it up in time to try it, so naturally I had to grab it when I saw it on today’s menu. Let’s see what it’s all about Pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing The nose is bright and enticing, but still carries a nice sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of lime zest, bready malt, cantaloupe, floral hops, gooseberry, light white wine, and white pepper It matches the intensity in taste, really striking a nice balance. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting orange juice, lime zest, crackery malt, gooseberry, earthy hops, light honey, toasted grain, and cantaloupe. The swallow brings notes of white grape, bready malt, floral hops, cantaloupe, pine sap, gooseberry, light lime, and honey A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet creamy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries over time Wow, this one is unique. Nelson is not a hop I really tend go enjoy usually, but this is just a wonderful expression of it.

I am using a tulip glass and serving the beer at 44 degrees. The pour created an airy, foamy, half-fingered head with no retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The color is reddish-brown with no clarity. The beer is not as murky as Homage, but it retains a brownish color with an interesting appearance. Nosing the beer, I detect raspberries, lightly toasted malts, earthiness, barnyard funk, acidic acid, lemons, and a light yeasty note. Lemons, berries, light toasted malts, acidic notes, barnyard funk, earthiness, a hint of phenol, wood, and leather dominate the first sip. The mouthfeel is mouth-puckering sour, finishing crisp. The body is light and has low carbonation. Final Thought: The beer has a sour component, yet it is well-balanced with the raspberries. The raspberry tartness, mixed with the beer's funky side, gives the beer depth and complexity. Still recovering from jet lag and a busy day, this is a fantastic finish. Aug 24, 2025 Report",

I can’t say that it smells particularly sour, but there’s some lactic tartness and citrus rind.  Quite complex and a wonderful nose. 4.75 T: Taste follows with a big plastic like funk up front, which quickly yields to floral and citrus notes, with big oaky vanilla on the finish that lingers forever. Taste is quite tart and sour but it’s not as puckering as many lambics.  The raspberry characters are present but certainly not prominent,  not sure to what extent that’s due to the age.  4.5 M/D: Mouthfeel is lighter side of medium bodied with a big but appropriate carbonation and incredible drinkability.

Not sure if it was worth the difficulty in obtaining as I think I prefer Cantillon Rose de Gabrinus when it comes to Raspberry lambics (and I’ve surprisingly found the other easy to get over the years).

My favorite beer store. This 375 ml was very expensive but I have been after this beer for 15 years. Also got Hommage and may save that for beer rating/review #2k. Bottled on 18 Dec 2019. A- Body is a uniformly hazy orange with a hint of pink. Perhaps sunset in color. There is no head or lacing to speak of. S- The nose is complex yet simple. Tart raspberries, cheesecloth, funk, oak barrel, breadiness. T- The flavor is much like the nose- sweet and tart authentic raspberries upfront with a light bready yeast backbone. The finish is quite sour but a softness from the oak barrel lingers on with some sourness long after you swallow. F- Medium carbonation and a medium weight body. There is a lot of acidity in the body with a light bread yeast feel too. O- This beer is truly world class. It's the definition of a traditional fruit lambic and it is brewed so carefully and so well.  It definitely gets better and you appreciate it more as it goes down. It's quite expensive so if you don't like more traditional sours or you don't like raspberries than don't bother. Dec 03, 2022 Report",4.32

Aroma features fresh raspberries and funk (leather, barnyard) with some oak and malt. Some green apple/lemon as well. Flavor is similar but with a malty sweetness that I can't quite describe; almost like someone added a shot of simple syrup. This detracts from the overall flavor profile. Moderate tartness. Moderate funk. Nice fruit. Overall it's solid but not something I'd feel the need to buy again.

Mild, sharply tart, red fruit aromas of raspberry, cherry; light funk, light lemon juice. At first the near absence of carbonation is a put off, but there is a very fine, prickly feel, and it ends up doing the job; flavour is appropriately sour, pleasantly puckering, balanced by a light fruity sweetness - like red currants more than anything; have to use your imagination to get a clear sense of raspberry, it's very subtle; there is a faint mustiness and oakiness; long, very dry finish, enticing, lightly sticky.

Very minimal visible carbonation, S: great raspberry-forward nose, on a slightly funky and tart lambic foundation. Raspberry flavor is fairly sweet, makes me think of raspberry sorbet. Lambic funk has a bit of that barnyard/cheese thing going on, second fiddle to the raspberry (as is the tart aroma for that matter). Cheese funk and acidity ramp up now that it’s hit room temperature, raspberry still there but secondary T: flips here a bit, would say I get that lambic funk first followed quickly by the raspberry - or at least they’re neck and neck. More tart to open with a bit of cheesy funk at first, followed closely by that sweeter raspberry character from the nose. Medium finish that ends nicely tart and acidic, moderately drying. Once it’s hit room temperature the base beer shines through much more, leaving a yeasty note in the finish I wasn’t getting before. Great balanced oak character F: medium carbonation, medium- body, medium+ acidity a bit elevated as it hits room temp O: a delicious fruited lambic, captures the fruit well while staying true to the funky/wild parts of the brew. A pinch on the sweet side at first, as it warms up that mellows with the base lambic shining through more. Overall great, as I expected a delicious Belgian beer Oct 06, 2020 Report",4.46

An essentially perfect appearing beer. Aroma has a huge minerality, only mild lactic tartness, subtle pungent funk, not much fruit. Taste is burnt plastic like funk, some bitterness, moderate tart sourness, blueberries are subtle. I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons.  It’s very clean, crispy even, with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. Overall, a very nice beer. Is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it?

I had a bottle at home so what follows first is my review of that 2018 bottle opened on Zwanze Day 2019. Appearance is foggy vibrant burnt red with a tall uneven pinkish-white foam head that slowly settles to a thin film and creamy collar. Blåbær exhibits tanniny skins and hella oak that has a nutty splintery dusty character. The lambic has an olive brine funk and is more sour than other loons, but it needs to warm up to develop away from vinegar with more pleasant notes of red wine as the prickly semi-dry finish becomes smoother as it warm. In both experiences, I never really got a definitive blueberry character, but that has been the trend with many other blueberry lambics and saisons I've had across the board. --- Yep, I got to enjoy this lambic whale at DLD. It was fluffier than I expected, and expressed more oaky barnyard funk than it did fruit, but was quite enjoyable. I didn't flip my shit over it, but I didn't get a full glass of it either.

Pours jet black with a super thin tan head around the circumference of the glass. No lacing. Smell is rum and chocolate upfront, with coffee kicking in just a little bit after. The booze is strong on the nose, but a bit of vanilla is there to balance it. Taste follows the nose. The booze sting is minimal considering the ABV. Good balance between the sweet vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. The spices and coffee combine for an earthy finish that doesn’t last longer than it should. Feel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. It doesn’t stick much or leave a thick residue on the tongue, which for me sets it apart a bit from other Prairie stouts. Overall, quite good. I had a tough time assigning numbers to this one, so I looked back through my previous ratings on various stouts, and eventually decided that I had to give this one 4.25 straight through.

I find this bottled version (15%) with slight age to be even greater than the first; the chillies are more prominent, but the body still packs plenty of rich chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. The chillies generally save their heat until the finish; while the rum notes come to increased prominence over the chocolate as the brew warms. The mouthfeel I find to be moderately thicc, though not as much as one might expect from a such a high gravity stout; present but not in a weighty manner.

I tried the original stout, and it was delicious. I am serving the beer at 50 degrees in a tulip glass. The pour created a half-fingered, dark tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The color is inky black with dark rusty brown hues. It is semi-transparent and charting at SRM 36. Overall, it is a below-average showing for a high-ABV stout. Nosing the glass, I detect toffee, dark-roasted coffee, a hint of char, Maillard, whiskey, dark chocolate, dark-roasted malts, wood resin, treacle, caramel, tobacco, earthiness, and a malty sweetness. Sipping the glass, I taste dark chocolate, char, toffee, medium coffee, molasses, caramel, leather, dates, whiskey, wood resin, earthiness, malty sweetness, and tobacco. The mouthfeel is chewy and coating, finishing silky-soft with a slight warming sensation. The body is heavy and low in carbonation. A solid example of a barrel-aged stout is a standard that many brewers have difficulty recreating—no frills, yet well-crafted, with typical flavors. May 08, 2025 Report",4.47

Head dissipates into a nice ring of tiny bubbles and leaves pockets of lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, barrel, coffee, vanilla. Taste is very barrel-forward, both in presence of whiskey spirit and oak, followed by coffee and hints of vanilla and dark chocolate (last two required some digging given the other dominating flavors). Drinks hotter than I would have expected but anything that has coffee, I generally prefer to tackle before it mutes out; I think this would benefit with 12-24 months of age on it. Some light gastric warming but probably more to do with an empty stomach. Mouthfeel is thin with prickly carbonation. Finish is charred wood, oak tannins, whiskey, and bitter coffee.

Canned 10/10/2023. Bought it at Ridgewood two months ago. Pours black with a small, dark brown head that settles into a small, light tan ring. Looks still and opaque. Smell is rich, very rich, vanilla and chocolate, boozy and oaky and char and coffee. Taste is way on the boozy side, don't get nearly as much of the delightful panoply of sensations as I got in the nose. Maybe that'll change as it warms. Coffee and bitter dates dominate the flavor otherwise. Mouthfeel is thick, not sticky or chewy, just big. Overall, not bad, but not fantastic. Nov 30, 2024 Report",4.06

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by Whyteboar from Michigan 4.47 /5 rDev -0.9% look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Enjoyed with a friend.  Sent to us by a friend: @Resistance88 Poured oil-like into our glasses, black as a moonless night and capped with a brown head they left reasonable lacing. Sadly, my nose is Covid damaged and the aroma was too faint for me to properly describe. The taste though - Speedway is one of our favorite stouts as it is, and this one is easily just as tasty, just differently so.  More smooth and bourbon like heat that accompanies the existing coffee and dark chocolate flavors; all bitterness from the coffee or malt roast is gone.  If BBA stouts are a treat for you, seek this out. The feel is soft and the visible viscosity doesn't let me down.  It feels like a high ABV stout and seems to need all that body to carry the amount of flavor packed into this. Apr 24, 2024 Report",4.47

The smell is absolutely delicious. The bourbon and coffee come out first and followed by a nice mild and soft vanilla alongside a bittersweet dark chocolate. There is a noticeable alcohol note that shines through but doesn't really hurt it that much. The taste is phenomenal! It has the same notes as the smell with a few additions. The oak note is more present in the taste and lasts through the whole thing. The bitter coffee note comes out first and the bourbon doesn't show up until towards the finish alongside the chocolate. There is also no alcohol notes. The feel is good. It has a very smooth body with a tingling feeling from the carbonation. It also packs quite a bit of heat for a barrel aged beer. Overall, this is a delicious beer worth getting and holding for a bit because it definitely tastes like it can develop a bit more fully than it has right now. Dec 03, 2022 Report",4.46

Label identifies this as '2022' product. Black colored body, with an extremely thin dark mahogany back lit edge. 1-1/2 mocha brown head, which settles back to an interrupted cap with an active surface. Leaves a couple of thin strings of lacing. Aroma of roasted barley malt, dark coffee, and dark chocolate. Has vanilla and sweet bourbon. Taste has bourbon drenching all the flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and dark coffee. Has some expression of dark cherry. Chocolate first and then coffee. The bourbon, with its vanilla, cover everything and extend far into the aftertaste. Seems like a thin mouth feel at first, but thickens as the body is held in the mouth. Slight coating after each sip. Noticeable alcohol burn on the tongue. Supportive carbonation. This is a great sipping brew, similar to a slow sipping whiskey. Savor each sip to get the full expression. Jul 30, 2022 Report",4.36

I have been getting this with stouts for a while now, and I definitely, get it with this beer, but soy sauce is a part of the taste. Fantastic feel. Super rich texture, almost creamy.

Now, to be honest, I don’t know much about old George; but the fact that he made it to the ripe old age of 100 is pretty dandy in my book. Meanwhile, a beer that’s rated 100 on BA is pretty wild too. Coming full circle, I’m feeling it. Barrel Aged Speedway might not be as cool as some old dude who smoked cigars a good deal of his life and lasted so long, but it’s like the cool dude at your local Elks Lodge who smashes at Shuffleboard and randomly buys you a beer because he’s cool like that.

I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla, and dark chocolate.  Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some oak, dark bready and burnt/charred malt flavors noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich, coating and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation.  This is a pretty good straight up barrel aged version of a classic imperial stout, really liked this one a lot!

Keep cold, drink fresh, canned 6/26/2025. Opaque, and slightly custard like in appearance with a deep muted orange to mostly gold-yellow color.  Super creamy white forming head that easily makes three solid fingers in height with real fine bubbles that are nearly nitrous looking.  Ring lacing and staying power abound with huge retention and a big island moat cap rounds it all out, and the head just coats all the way down while drinking. Just about the perfect aroma on an IPA I have ever had.  Juicy sensing orange, that covers all the pulp, rind, zest and oils.  Spicy earth with a touch of taffy like candy even peppermint sweetness, that has a sensation more like vanilla or cream.  Incredible melon like juicy character with blossom sweet orange like florals as well.  This is an absolute hop showcase that is full of variety, balance, and incredible flavor.  Mind blown already. This really had to sink in for a bit.  The first sip has a light but trully accessible feel that does give a great platform.  My first thought was it might be hinting a little thin but then the flavors explode.  There is an intense orange and melon/cantaloupe like flavor on first sip that just permeates, giving to all those hinted aromas before, and a real good sweetness that is impecably balanced and not overly sugary.  Tropical rushes hit on the finish with an even bigger surprise.  The finish balloons with intense green leaf notes of tea, mint that is heightened by the already first sweet orange/melon/tropical rush.  Then the swallow brings unexpected hop joy.  There is a wonderful controlled bitter heat that punches with zesty oils at first, then builds to wonderful controlled billowing heat of black and white pepper, almost as if I am eating scoville punched poblanos with incredible control. My mind is blown.  This has NEIPA classic character, with better diversity, heightened bitterness of hop that is varied and complex, and exceptionally touched classic NEIPA sweetness that is PERFECTLY controlled.  This also clocks in at 8.8% abv.  I can't even TELL.  In all my years of reviewing beers, and seeing dozens of takes on IPAs, this is the beer that has truly dialed to pretty much perfection on the bullseye, I mean they NAILED it.  It is hands down right now the best IPA I have ever had in my life to date.  I don't want anything else.  I want more of this and don’t care about ANY other beer right now, that's how good it is, and that's saying a lot. Jul 10, 2025 Report",4.91

Emperor Julius,"Reviewed by JohnG190 from New York 4.93 /5 rDev +8.6% look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5 Appearance: Pours a majestic, hazy deep orange with golden highlights, crowned by a dense, creamy white crown that lingers and leaves heavy lacing on the glass. The haze is intense, giving it a luscious, almost smoothie-like appearance. This beer looks as bold and regal as its name suggests. Aroma: The aroma is a blend of tropical and citrus fruits, featuring ripe mango and pineapple with undertones of orange zest and hints of peach adding to the complexity, while a subtle dank, resinous hop character provides balance. There's other fruits in there, I'm just not sure what. The nose is bright, fresh, and deeply aromatic, showcasing the full intensity of the hops. Palate: On the palate, Emperor Julius is a tropical fruit explosion. Juicy orange, mango, and pineapple dominate, followed by layers of peach and subtle grapefruit. Again, there's another fruit flavor in there but I can't coax it out, melon? Papaya? Some other tropical fruit? The malt sweetness provides a smooth, honey-like backdrop, perfectly balancing the beer’s bold hop bitterness. The resinous hops make a stronger statement here, adding depth and a satisfying bite that lingers into the finish. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is luxurious and full-bodied, with a creamy, velvety texture that envelops the palate. The carbonation is soft but sufficient, keeping the beer lively without detracting from its smoothness. Despite its intensity and higher ABV, it drinks remarkably smoothly, with a slightly dry finish that invites another sip. Overall: Emperor Julius is a monumental hazy IPA and is the finest of the great Julius line (that I've had).  Its perfectly balanced blend of tropical and citrus flavors, bold hop profile, and creamy mouthfeel create a drinking experience that feels both indulgent and refined. This is a beer for those who appreciate bold, fruit-forward IPAs with a touch of regal bitterness. Emperor Julius lives up to its name, standing tall as one of Tree House’s finest creations. And the can is pure art! This is a perfect hazy IPA in my estimation. Jan 05, 2025 Report",4.93

Thanks again, Darwin! L: Opaque, murky, sunset orange in the glass, with a long-lasting, bubbly head and lots of carbonation visible if I peer hard enough into the murk. S: The nose is boozy mango and orange with the slightest touch of piney darkness. It's more restrained than the previous Tree House beers I've drunk. T: The taste mirrors the nose with boozy, juicy, orange, mango, and apricot.  There's enough bitterness to give the beer some punch and balance the sweetness but not enough to scare away even the most neophyte hazeboi.  That said, what sweetness does persist means it's a one-and-done beer for me. M: The beer is thick and smooth, with a velvety mouthfeel, minimal carbonation and enough bite on the swallow to help with balance. O:  This is a lovely beer.  It's just over a month old, drinking smoothly and sweetly, and shows the depth of flavour that modern hops, clever grain bills and elite brewers can produce.  For a can that was muled to Australia from the USA, it's in immaculate condition and makes me long all the more for a chance to drink this fresh onsite at Tree House.  One day...

Thick, frothy, off-white head forms on the beer, lingers for a moment, then dissipates leaving just a small mound of residual foam. Sticky lacing coats the glass as the beer is consumed. Aroma has notes of guava, passionfruit, orange, citrus, and some tropical fruits. Absolutely lovely on the nose. Taste somewhat follows the nose - those fruity notes are there - orange, passion fruit, and guava amongst others - but the flavor profile is decidedly less fruity than the nose implied. Moderate hoppy bitterness comes through in the profile. Nice balance between the fruity sweetness and the hoppy bitterness. Feel is thick, a bit heavy, and very full bodied. Nice carbonation for as heavy as the beer actually ends up being. Overall it is a lovely NEIPA - a testament to the quality of Tree House. Apr 07, 2024 Report",4.27

Backed by the Tree House clan and new conquests are ahead. Turbidly hazy and cast in a pastel golden taupe appearance, Emperor Julius slowly separates from the ale with an ivory mousse of froth. As its musty fruits rise from the foam, notions of tropical fruit, citrus, stone fruit and melon carry an over ripened yet juicy scent. Sweeter on the tongue, the full flavor and textures of poundcake, honey and dough all smoothen out the early palate. As the lusciously hoppy ale rolls along the middle palate, the tastebuds are awaken with the tropical flavors os papaya, passionfruit, mango and pineapple with a citrusy followup from grapefruit, tangerine and lime. All wrapped in the juiciness of cantaloup and apricot and the fruit flavors are nearly complete. Seemingly macerated and over ripened in their taste and a transition to an herbal, peppery, grassy and damp sod bitterness is seamless. Full bodied, creamy and richly malted to the palate, a full bed of cereal is too much for Julius to overcome. An attempt to overwhelm with hops comes with exposures of earthy, dank and vegetal bitterness that gives rise to his foes. As the ale finishes malty-dry and bitter-sweet, the session lacks refreshment or drinkability, albeit still quite good. Nov 08, 2023 Report",4.24

After a couple TH beers that seemed noticeably different in overall profile than my memory of them, I was starting to get worried that either they had majorly tweaked something, my memory was failing, my senses were wonky, or (worst of all) that I had fallen prey to reverse lupulin threshold shift. But praise be! That doesn't seem to be the case. This bad boy is dead on. From the look to the aroma to the taste to the palate, the whole thing just pops and met my standard (unconscious audible groan/swearing) for being nigh-perfect. Solid representation of the style, to my tastes and noticeably a Tree House character. Can't do much better than that. The nose and flavor are big characterful mixes of sweet citrus, ripe mango with a dash of boozy citrus/lupuline oil aromatics. Like the oil that you can see spray off a twisted rind of the light is just right. The flavor is similar and has a nice bitter but not overly bitter, boozy but not too much finish to it that kind of dissolves into orange rind and makes it take all my concentration to not just plow through the glass. As it warms (and this one started out at cellar temp*) the perfumey/boozy character mentioned above melts into a creamy, sweet sort of character that really ties the whole beer together and sums up that classic estery, fruity, soft, juicy TH character.  Simply excellent. Glad I have a couple more and many thanks, Minor God of Drunken Flannel, for peer pressuring me into buying it. 4.25...4.5...4.75...4.75...4.75** *- Actually, typing this out I realized this is the first of these recent Tree House beers that came out of my trusty beer fridge (48.5°) and not a normal fridge temps below 40. I think there well could be something to that and my last 3-4 seeming a little lackluster. Lesson to you kids out there that warmer is often better contrary to what Big Beer™ brainwashes us with. **- the last drink in the glass made me unconsciously curse out loud alone on my balcony. Better than the first sip, bumped overall up 0.25 points. Aug 15, 2023 Report",4.66

Emperor Julius,"Reviewed by Damian from Massachusetts 4.15 /5 rDev -8.6% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Tewksbury, MA 3/15/23 Served in a tulip Medium bodied and somewhat darker, dullish orange in appearance. The liquid was topped by a small, creamy white head that quickly broke into a bubbly, lasting halo. Drippy, streaky lacing cascaded down the sides of the glass. The aroma was solid. There was a strong generic topical fruit presence initially, but it was soon overtaken by potent citrus notes. Bit of rind-like pith too. The alcohol was definitely punchier than I anticipated. Booze spiked oranges came to mind. Dry, powdery yeasty notes were initially detectable, but they soon dissipated. Some bubblegum was also noticeable. Ripe mango was apparent too, and it intensified as the beer warmed. The flavor profile was super citrus forward from start to finish. Orange notes came through strong up front. Juicy orange flesh soon transformed into pithy, bitter orange rind as the beer moved along the palate. Grapefruit notes took over in the center. Quite dry and bitter. More lingering, pithy citrus rind on the back end and the finish. Some dry, yeasty notes were apparent on the second pour. Nice fluffy mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Creamy, slick and smooth on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence. Emperor Julius is an enjoyable beer for sure, though it did not blow me away as I had hoped. Tree House may have become famous for their Julius series IPAs, but compared to other hoppy offerings, they now seem to lack complexity and nuance. Apr 19, 2023 Report",4.15
Emperor Julius,"Reviewed by Roguer from Connecticut 4.61 /5 rDev +1.5% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5 Very good head production, retention, and lacing. Beautiful beer for the style. Aroma is wonderful and potent, with a nicely present bitterness, and hop notes of mango, pineapple, guava, tangerine, basil, cream, and lemon zest. Just as balanced and potent on the palate, with similar tasting notes. It has that classic orange creamsicle note of OG Julius, along with a heavier, creamier malt base, and more of an alcohol note (really, any alcohol note is ""more"" than Julius). You can definitely tell, in this case, that you're drinking a big beer. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but there's much more sting than I expected. One the one hand, that makes it a bit livelier and more refreshing; on the other, it's less pillowy and creamy than what you might expect from Tree House. This is an absolute home run. Tree House variations (improvements, some might say) on their core beers (Julius, Haze, Green, et al) aren't always better than the originals, in my opinion. This is one that arguably improves on the original in almost every way. Apr 10, 2023 Report",4.61

Appearance is hazy deep gold, pretty opaque. 1 finger foamy off white head. Cling and lacing evident on the glass. Aroma is pine resin, mango, passionfruit, pineapple, dank, some citrus, maltiness and toast is evident. The nose is complex and wonderful. Taste follows the nose with a burst of juicy goodness....lots of tropical flavors happening here. The hops up front here scream big boy beer. Floral notes, pine resin, orange, yeasty biscuits, apricot. The hoppy goodness is quickly balanced as toasted malty sweetness builds. Complexity rules here....deep NEIPA flavors. There is a peppery back to this that is nice in the throat. Mouthfeel is fuller side of medium. Almost has a creamy feel in the mouth due to the amount of carbonation, but this finishes slightly dry which is a good thing that helps round this one out. Overall, this is a big beer and a great rendition of a NEIPA. Very well crafted and imho much tastier,  deeper, complex, and balanced than the regular version of King Sue (which is also pretty darn good btw).

This place is massive and out in the middle of nowhere, Iowa. The brewpub brimmed with patrons, and the parking lot was overflowing; seeing it was amazing. It reminds me of a Field of Dreams: you build it, and they will come. I use my New King Sue glass like I need more beer glasses, serving the beer at 46 degrees. The pour created a frothy, airy, creamy, two-fingered, light tan head with exceptional head retention. The slow dissipation left chunks of lacing on the glass. The color is pale amber with a lovely golden hue, hazy, and charts at SRM 8. The appearance of this beer is stellar. Nosing the glass, I can smell oranges, lemons, light papaya, pineapple, apricots, peaches, gooseberries, herbal and floral bouquets, grapefruit, mangos, lightly toasted malts, biscuits, crackers, and malty sweetness. The flavors are a pungent hop profile of oranges, lemons, resin, mango, apricots, gooseberries, bay leaves, floral esters, grapefruit, and pineapple. The massive onslaught of hops is held firm with a strong malt backbone of lightly toasted malts, bready biscuits, and crackers with a lovely malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is astringent and finishes crisp. The body is medium and has medium carbonation. Final Thought: King Sue Double Dry Hop is a massive beer with an onslaught of Citra hops. Considering how fresh the beer is, few examples exceed its quality, most notably Heddy Topper. I loved sipping this beer and wished I could have brought a case back on the plane; this is my last can, and I am sad to see it go. Jun 25, 2025 Report",4.77

T - Follows the nose, with a big tropical juice note, more clearly pineapple and passionfruit, mango and a touch of peach, that flows into a citrus hit of orange and grapefruit in the middle, and a subtle bitterness of pith, with powerful acidity in the finish. M - Strong acidity and moderate carbonation do battle against the heavier juice notes, scrubbing away most of the weight.  A dry finish leaves just a touch of resin in the close.

That being said, Tavour has been getting me back into them lately with relatively fresh cans. Admittedly, I should’ve gotten around to this one sooner since I’ve had it for a few weeks, but I’m excited to try it regardless. Let’s get into it Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing The nose is vibrant and tropical, but there’s a nice bitter hop character to it as well. I’m picking up on aromas of orange juice, lemon zest, overripe cantaloupe, floral hops, bready malt, gooseberry, dank weed, dried blueberry, and light grass And it manages to keep up that wonderful balance in taste too thankfully. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe cantaloupe, pineapple juice, bready malt, grassy hops, blueberry candy, dank weed, and light orange zest. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, gooseberry, crackery malt, dank weed, grassy hops, pineapple juice, overripe cantaloupe, and light grapefruit zest A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing Oh yeah, this one is great. Super drinkable for the style with a great balance Apr 24, 2023 Report",4.54

Canned Nov 28th 2022. Light touching head, with ultra fine bright white bubbles.  Lots of pill like lacing and even leggy.  Island creamy top with a soft shape, sitting on a slightly hazed dark lemon, with hints of noticeable fast rising carbonation. A bold nose.  Dank hits of earth and must hop, but also a real tropical passionfruit like flavor.  Hits nice and spicy too, with a bevy of hop explosive power.  Nice and diverse but just misses the wow factor, and other beer character balance. Palate is just real nice.  Juiced up and filled with a rich malt coating, hop flavoring of passionfruit, pineapple, and a real jammy like texture.  Coats a little chalky but also brings a real nice spicy earthy hop bitterness on the finish.  Good notes of tropical variety too, guava, mango all sorts of fruit tropical goodness.

Good head production and retention; excellent lacing. Body is a hue somewhere around mango flesh, hazy but not pulpy, and opaque except in the thinnest portions of the glass. Nose is bold, strong, and bursting with juicy hop notes. Mango, peach, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and a slight dankness. Super juicy on the palate, really delivering notes of papaya and mango - and very little else, but in the best possible way. Moderate bitterness (low for an IPA), and a soft, semi-sweet pale doughy malt base that really amplifies the juiciness. Near perfect mouthfeel, on par with Tree House (the best in the NE IPA game, in my opinion). Creamy and soft, yet with plenty of bite; high-medium to light-full body, with excellent (dangerous) drinkability despite the high ABV. This beer is the real deal. Absolutely superb.

Wondering if my glass wasn't as sparkly clean as I thought. Nose is leaning towards overripe, almost rotting, papaya and garlic. Fortunately the flavor leans more towards ripe papaya and the rotten fermenting fruit in the nose isn't present in the taste. Sunny delight and somewhat dank as well.   Mouthfeel is awesome actually...soft without being flabby and retaining some crispness. Overall, not really what I was expecting from a mosaic-led beer from OH.

I never thought I would get over 1000 reviews when I started this. I am looking forward to the next 100 until it comes time for 5000 reviews. For this milestone, I chose a behemoth, Grey Monday, from 2019. The name 'Grey Monday' is a nod to the intense, complex flavors of this beer, which make it a perfect choice for a contemplative, rainy day. I was using a tulip glass and served the beer at 50 degrees. The pour created a frothy, airy, one-fingered, light tan head with poor retention. The semi-quick retention left no lacing on the glass. The color is inky black and opaque, charting at SRM 38. This beer is beautiful; I am okay with the quick dissipation because of the 20.8 ABV. Bringing the glass to my nose, I'm greeted by a symphony of aromas. The massive oak barrel, the intense bourbon, the nutty, and chocolate notes all dance together. Nosing the glass again, I pick up on the subtler hints of coffee, tobacco, char, earthy tones, alcohol, molasses, raisins, figs, caramel, toffee, Maillard, burnt sugar, nutty, vanilla, light char, and oranges. This beer is a sensory adventure, with each aroma adding a new layer to its complexity. The first sip of Grey Monday is a revelation. The flavors burst forth, starting with a massive nuttiness that's a perfect blend of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, char, and oak. It's like a delicious nut butter mixed with fine chocolate, reminiscent of Nutella but with a sophisticated twist. As the beer's flavor develop on the palate toffee, caramel, molasses, char, tobacco, vanilla, and earthy notes. The double barrel created a huge complex depth to the beer with oak, bourbon, char, and caramel notes.  This beer is a unique experience, a journey of flavors that keeps you returning for more. I was expecting this chewy mouthfeel, but it was more than that. The beer coats your tongue and palate, leaving a rich, dense finish that warms you from the inside. The body is heavy and has medium carbonation, adding to the overall luxurious mouthfeel. I am grateful that Grey Monday wasn't overly heavy and chewy, as I had expected. The beer's high ABV didn't make it too hot, and I loved the expressive nuttiness. The barrel aging was just right, not overpowering the other flavors. I'm not sure how they achieved this balance, where I'm not only sipping on wood. This is truly an enjoyable Stout, especially on a chilly, damp Idaho evening. Sep 12, 2024 Report",4.71

Pours dark brown, not as dark as I expected, nearly still, basically no head. Smell is mild alcohol up front, tons of chocolate, some coffee and vanilla. Taste is not as boozy as I was afraid, though definitely boozy. I get vanilla and spice before chocolate and plums. Label says hazelnut, but I think that specific flavor is either lost to time or drowned out by the booze, vanilla, and char. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected, only medium bodied, and has a bit of a dry texture which really surprises me.

Plus it’s also another top 250 list tick. This is a big ass bottle that I’ll likely be attacking all night so let’s stop wasting time and get right into it Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing Right off the jump, there isn’t much hazelnut present in the nose, but it’s still interesting nonetheless. I’m picking up on aromas of molasses, earthy bourbon, peat smoke, sea salt, cocoa powder, toasted hazelnut, dry oak, light vanilla, and raisin The hazelnuts definitely express a bit more in taste, though they still aren’t exactly at the forefront. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting cocoa powder, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, toasted oak, black cherry, burnt caramel, vanilla, sea salt, and smoky tobacco. The swallow brings notes of dark chocolate, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, sea salt, peat smoke, sea salt, molasses, dry oak, burnt caramel, and light vanilla A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv. Like literally less than half and that’s easily the most impressive part of this one I struggle with this one. It’s definitely not top 250 material, and the adjunct isn’t really the star, but on the other hand it’s (dangerously) drinkable and pretty unique. Worth a shot for sure Jul 04, 2023 Report",4.31
Grey Monday,"Reviewed by darktronica from Indiana 4.2 /5 rDev -6.9% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25 750mL bottle, 2021 edition sent to new Society members under their new nationwide shipping policy. Very little difference from the base Black Tuesday, if I'm honest, having had regular BT many times but this being my first Grey Monday. That means it's excellent, but the hazelnut treatment is pretty muted at this point (if it was ever more prominent), yielding a slight generic nuttiness with a touch of additional sweetness. It's not Nutella, that's for sure. It also suffers the same shortcomings of the standard BT, being very thin on mouthfeel for the ultra-high ABV and pretty hot on bourbon heat once it warms up a bit.

Fizzy cola head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Nose has a hint of hazelnuts right off the bat before giving way to big waves of whiskey and rum, molasses, dark soy sauce, barley, oyster sauce, and vanilla. Flavor is a little tough to place. Heat - both warming booze and sharp ethanol - pop right away. There's significant salinity that's different from Black Tuesday - less deep, blackstrap molasses, more brackish sea spray or even oysters. Malts, soy sauce, black licorice are there, but with less intensity than BT. The nuts come forward as it warms, and though it's hard to definitively place hazelnuts, they would be a guess along with peanuts and hazelnuts - definitely nothing too fatty like a walnut. Mouthfeel is remarkably thin for this kind of beer (I'd call it ""moderate""), especially when compared to BT or a BCBS. That's not bad per se, but I think the feel contributes to the overall heat and sharpness. This was interesting - though I'm not sure I'd be keen to shell out for another bottle.

Its a blood-burgundy color with a clear transparency when direct sunlight pierces it. Head is a finger of khaki-caramel foam after a slow pour, but it fizzles out quickly. Aroma is raisins, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate and roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty and caramely malts. Heat is seeping through pretty heavy with a whollop of bourbon booze at the back. Flavor profile is raisins, figs, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate, molasses and syrup with hearty roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely and bready malts. It's thick, thick and thick. Drinking a boozy cookie. Bourbon adds heat that seems in and lingers long after the malts wash away. A touch of char adds a little grounding bitterness for the sugary initiation.

Reviewed 1/26/20. “2018 Edition”.  Etched on the shoulder above the rear label “B#573 6/25/18” above “11:19 005479”.  Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees (as stated on the label) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Final temperature 62 degrees F. Appearance – 3. First pour – Medium brown, clear. Body – Dark brown/black, opaque.  When held to direct light, a very deep red-amber, translucent. No legs. Head – Large (Maximum four cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles nosily popping, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin partial ring of tiny bubbles, fed by effervescence.  While not fizzy, the head demonstrates no tendency to last.  At 18.9% ABV, this is not surprising. Lacing – None, again 18.9% ABV. Aroma – 4 - Has an almost watery raisin aroma with some weak wood and possibly bourbon in the background. Flavor – 4 – The flavor is somewhat elusive, starting slightly sweet and a bit fruity, without bourbon, oak, or hazelnut. The nasal raisins seem to be dominant.  No alcohol (18.9% ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor, but massive numbing of the tongue and soft palate as it warms while being held in the mouth.  Alcohol on the exhale.  No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops. Palate – 4 – Medium, just short of syrupy, lively carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4.  The appearance in unremarkable, looking like any headless imperial stout.  The aroma is most like Flying Dog’s Raison D’Etre, at least to my burnt-out lab nose.  In the flavor I find no hint of hazelnuts, oak, or bourbon, just a generic sweetness with a hint of DARK FRUIT, something I didn’t taste (other than raisins) until I was typing this summary.  Palate feels good, but I’ve corked the bottle after one glass, so I don’t wake up with my head on the keyboard and beer leaking onto the motherboard (Incidentally, Mrs. Lizard has miraculously appeared and approved the corking of the bottle for later.  Maybe today I won’t sleep through Noir Alley!)  Overall, I’ve probably rated this too high, but it’s from The Bruery, so, by definition, it HAS to be a superior brew. Jan 26, 2020 Report",3.94

Grey Monday,"Reviewed by Roguer from Connecticut 4.35 /5 rDev -3.5% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75 No head retention. Fairly clear and pale, more like a strong ale than stout. Nose is almost all booze and brown sugar. No hint of hazelnuts. Brew is nutty on the palate, especially up front, followed by waves of brown sugar, grapes, dates, chocolate, oak, raisins, bourbon, and lots of boozy heat. Hot, big, boozy, and proud of it. This is a warming sipper that presents its booze well. Like the best, most complex Bruery beers, this is reminiscent of Utopias. I definitely feel it’s more of a strong ale, as I don’t get much of a stout feel to this. May 20, 2019 Report",4.35

I decided, probably in error, to drink a bottle by myself on a Tuesday evening. I had two Grey Mondays gathering dust in my cellar - and no one ever wants to open these at shares, so I thought I might start thinning the herd. Full disclosure: I only finished one glass before falling asleep. Appearance brings to mind a barleywine, more than a stout - Grey Monday pours a deep reddish brown and smells tremendously boozy. Seriously, this stuff makes my head swim. Hazelnuts are faint in the nose, but there's definitely a bit of warm nuttiness there. It's quite sweet and fairly sticky, thick, and oily. While Bruery stouts aren't my every day go-to, it's difficult to deny them accolades - these beers are nuts. Delicious, but they just aren't practical when drinking alone! Apr 10, 2019 Report",4.47

It was sweet, giving me the impression that I was getting some maple in the profile. The barrel was strong, leaving no doubt that this was barrel aged. It had the right balance and was not hot.

Coffee is mild, but integrated well. Bourbon hits right at the finish, notching the heat up right at the end, but not enough to push it into boozy or burning territory. Flavor profile is big roasty, toasty, and caramely malts with decadent layers of toffee, chocolate, and coffee throughout. Despite leaning into the darkness, it has playful hits of sweetness. Bourbon and char add a swell of bitterness and heat at the end, but not enough to upend the balance. Mouth feel is thick. It's full, creamy, and hearty. It's viscosity suggests a much higher alcohol percentage. Overall, a hefty, hearty stout enhanced by coffee and bourbon.

Split with my marvelous wife! The 750ML bottle has one of those handy tags that rips a hole in the wax big enough to get a bottle opener in, which my oft-punctured fingers appreciate. Silver wax sprays off & we’re into a big, black beer with minimal visible carbonation. The nose is Willy Wonka bar, coffee, & light, warm malts. Nice. Sump – Barrel Aged Coffee Stout is an odd breed of coffee stout. The coffee shows as roast in the nose & only faintly in the taste, which leans into herbs & dark fruit. Slotting in next is plenty of cocoa, char, lovely shot of whiskey, vanilla creamer, & what tastes like good old Wesley’s Maple Syrup. The Finnish is all NIN bass, dark, driving, tasty. Old school big stout thick (not pastry chef thick), which raises the drinkability level. This is a beer that is in no way, no form, no how worth the price of admission. It’s Sump plus a bit of char & whiskey. Still: Sump = Excellent, & the BA version continues that trend of excellence. Happy to have it in my mouth. Sep 17, 2019 Report",4.35

There’s a very big and very brash barrel character. It’s leather-like, spicy, caramelly, and slightly fruity. The vanilla is kinda bittersweet, a bit fruity and earthy, without descending into pure pastry. The base stout is very fudgy and roasty. The vanilla comes out a bit more strongly and sweetly as the beer warms up a little bit. This is medium bodied, not quite thick level, but definitely not even close to thin. There’s a bit of booze but nothing overwhelming. I definitely liked this one a lot, but it really wasn’t what I expected.

Super thick and sweet, right away this reminds me very much of Dark Lord, which I just so happened to have had right before this. We also had Goose Island's OG 2010 nilla, VR, and 2018 BCBS Vanilla right before this, so the contrasts and comparisons are all the more readily available. There's a little heat, and an almost maple sweetness, as notes of dark chocolate chip cookie and marshmallow fluff emerge mid-palate. But in the end, I wanted to like it more than I did. Being self-aware enough to recognize that, it's not as good as it's been made out to be. --- The above review was for the 2019 blend #2. I just had the pleasure of trying a 2020 blend #3 in July of 2021 and found the experience to be a little more enjoyable. Gobs of vanilla frosted brownie batter express up front, but shortly thereafter more barrel comes forth than I noticed in the prior vintage. It's more mature and very bourbon ribboned throughout the medium-thick body as a result, bringing it's crackly thin carbonation to a dry and fairly hot finish. I'm going to up my 4.17 review a bit. While a bit spicy, I like the trendline here. --- At Great Taste of the Midwest 2022, I had a taster of blend #5 that yet again reaffirmed both my enjoyment but slight underwhelment of this beer.

It’s charred and sweet, in balance, with roast, milk chocolate and dark chocolate both, with dried cherry, cookie dough, spiced vanilla, and espresso. There’s a ton of barrel here but it’s overall well integrated. This is intensely flavored but well structured, and somehow quite drinkable and not all that boozy.

Flavor is a punch in the face with chocolate char. Rich, espresso brownie batter, drying baker’s chocolate and bourbon-soaked Luxardo cherries. Finishes bone-dry, like an ultra dark chocolate dark, and lasts forever. Man, that’s intense! Mouthfeel is initially smooth and dense, but then goes almost soda-ish.

Featuring a blend of three standout barrels brewed and barreled in 2018, Truth is the purest expression of barrel-aged beer that we make. In the glass, we taste potent but balanced flavors of chocolate bourbon candy, sweet vanilla-like oak, tootsie rolls, and baker’s chocolate. Though the flavors are intense, they are beautifully balanced making Truth a joy to enjoy and savor as it warms up. We are proud of this beer, and being the first time we’ve been able to enjoy it in almost five years, we are feeling very nostalgic.

My last beer from my latest run to Tree House, and one that hasn’t been released in many years. Currently sitting at #84 of all time on BA, we have a straight up, no adjunct barrel aged Stout blend. Let’s crack open this special bottle Pours nearly pitch black and still, with just a small layer of tan bubbles than quickly fade to a thin ring that leaves no lacing but nice legs While I appreciate this not having the typical TH Stout sweetness in the nose, it’s not as complex as I had hoped though still good. I’m picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and raisin It is sweet in taste, but not in any cloying way, rather it is kept wonderfully in check by many complex notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting milk chocolate, plum, vanilla, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, black cherry, and burnt caramel. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, boozy bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, black cherry, pecan, toasted oak, and dark roast coffee A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sweet beer. Finishes sticky and heavy but not overwhelmingly sweet So this is very good, but I wouldn't consider it among the best of the best. Regardless, it was super fun to try, and a nice beer to wind down with Jun 19, 2022 Report",4.35

Served in a spiegelau IPA glass. Pours a thoroughly opaque, murky mango colour with a finger or so of super-soft, sudsy head. Retention is quite good, leaving a sudsy cap and a tattered blanket of foamy lacing. Nose is unexpectedly quite feeble. Subtle aroma of that signature TH peachy-bubblegum-yeasty thing but too faint to say much more than that. Taste follows the nose inasmuch as it isn’t as intense as I expected - which isn’t entirely a bad thing. Tasting fleshy peach, tangerine peel and a shit-ton of macerated bitter green tree leaves. The usual, expected supporting notes of mango, grapefruit juice, papaya and sticky pineapple. Feel is… this can is, what, nearly two weeks old and the hop-onslaught is still so intense that it no-shit made my throat constrict! I actually took a moment to wonder which of my neighbours was most likely to have an epi-pen. Aside from that, it’s soft and  juicy, medium bodied and brightly carbonated. Dry, sticky lips. Overall, aside from the epic hop-burn, it’s not as crazy as I might have expected - which, again, aside from the price, isn’t entirely a bad thing. Hey! what do you know, this is the 103rd Tree House beer I’ve reviewed. Point being: this one is virtually indistinguishable from probably 90% of the other TH NEIPA’s I’ve had.

Our assumption is that this is perhaps a little long in the tooth, even for a mythically legendary beer like this, but I have high hopes and great trust in the Belgian craftsmen who have honed this recipe through generations. And it seems that my trust was well allocated, because the smell is absolutely beautiful. Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength. But the taste is spicier, and while it borrows some of the chocolate from the nose, it expresses more like a mole with that kick.

Color is a deep, dark reddish brown, quite thick, with a mountain of light tan foam that will not go away. Really a beautiful pour. The aroma is deep but also vibrant, of red fruits and dark cherries as well as banana and spices, plus some molasses and brown sugar. There's a sweet clove and bubblegum note in there too that's very appealing. Flavor is sweet but the right kind of sweet. Not sticky and cloying, with a lot of brown sweet bread, more spice, and a lot less of those red fruits than I would've thought. Definitely cherries as well as some gently smoky tobacco. Finish is incredibly long, maturing into an impressive warmth with tons of brown sugar and molasses. It's not too sticky or coating and really a great sipper, in that you can drink it slowly and enjoy the complexity, but not HAVE to deal with being flooded with sugar or bitterness. I get the hype. It's great in every way and kicks the shit out of every quad I've drank so far. There's just nothing more smooth while still being deep and complex. Nov 21, 2024 Report",4.63

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Reviewed by alterbeerrush 4.41 /5 rDev -2% look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Finally got to try this much talked about beer last night and it definitely lived up to the hype. I've never tasted something so complex and layered. Initial impression when you open up the bottle and pour it is the striking caramel color (which might lead you into thinking it's a stout but the colour is lighter than a stout as you can notice when you hold it up against a light) along with strong aromas of spice and alcohol and hints of chocolate. It also has a nice foam that lasts for a long time. When you first taste it you might be taken aback by how undeniably smooth it is and how well the alcohol is masked in the sip. At 11% alcohol, you might feel that it will taste of that and nothing else but you'd be wrong. Alcohol is one of the last things you'll taste in this beer. Initially you'll taste coffee and spice along with a gentle, soothing sweetness that pleasantly compliments that stringent alcohol taste and in the finish you get a nice bitterness that is generally associated with beers. But the finish is not where this beer stops testing your senses. You'll feel warmth coursing through your body as this drink makes its way to your stomach where once it reaches you'll feel more pleasant warmth, a warmth that is comparable to the one felt while feasting on a soup or a stew. It's definitely a high quality and one of a kind beer that should be tried by every person interested in beer. It's a strong and complex tasting beer that is good to drink in winters and that too every once a while. I cannot see myself drinking this every other week, this is a once a two-three month kind of beer for me, not just due to the price but also due to the fact that its so much to take in. This is the dark elixir that I imagine is drunk by royals in Game of Thrones. Aug 06, 2024 Report",4.41

The review below is an exact copy of my original RateBeer review from 02/25/2013. 330 ml (11.2 oz.) bottle.  Pours a dark, cola brown.  In fact, it looks just like Coca-cola.  Has a light-brown head that dissipates quickly.  Aromas of chocolate, caramel, and raisins.  Taste is, WOW!  Lightly-sweet, but not overly so, with flavors of cola, plum, and another fruit that I can’t quite put my finger on.  Has a medium body and texture.  Carbonation is pretty lively.  Finish is smooth and long with hints of brown sugar. This is one fine beer.  The only thing I might be inclined to change would be to make it a little fuller in body. Jun 03, 2024 Report",4.42

Folks, this might be one of the top 5 beers in the world.  I will say it is.  This bottle is just gorgeous.  It is plain, yet so very elegant.  I love the old-style lettering.  Just a beautiful label.  Opened with a nice ""pop"" and more smoke than I can remember when opening a beer.  Temperature right around that 55 degree F mark. Did a moderately strong pour.  It was almost like pouring out a coke.  The head was bubbly and ""spritzy"", tan in color, with an abundance of carbonation.  Color is on the dark side, reddish-dark brown and a bit hazy.  It looks fantastic in the glass.  Initial aroma presented a special richness, mostly dark fruits, prune, hints of toffee, dark truffle and maybe a little  caramel.  Intense and wonderful.  The first taste, wow.  This is something very, very special.  My goodness.  It is so well balanced, so smooth in the mouth, with a bit of heat from the alcohol as is slides down your throat.  You feel the heat all the way down to your belly, and you get a nice warm fuzzy going on.  My goodness, this is one fabulous ale.  It even numbs your tongue a bit.  Those dark fruits are pronounced with an uncanny sweetness to this.  Some brown sugar, and the 11.2% ABV is so well hidden in the taste.  You feel it more than you taste it.  I pick up some grape, like a red wine in there.  For a dark ale, you'd expect maybe some malty flavor or smokiness, but there isn't any to be found.  This is a glorious ale my friends.  Wow Wee.   Getting some toffee in this next mouthful.  It is exceptionally rich, complex, well balanced and much sweeter than I thought it would be.  Just a fantastic world-class ale.   Don't let the price shy you away.  It is a must to try.  For me, if I had to choose one beer to drink for the rest of my life, this would be that beer.  Hands down.  Go get ya one now!

Maybe that clouds my judgement. Compared to other quads, this was much more volatile and savoury in nature. The volatility drove the aromatc profile. After quads that were more like liquid banana bread and very malty, this did stand out, and in a good way. But, it also stood out because of the overt alcohol on nose and palate. It seemed a little too unbalanced despite its uniqueness. Maybe I had it too warm, but an unblanaced beer is just an unblanaced beer at the end of the day. Jan 30, 2024 Report",2.56

There's very little malt and only a little more vague fruit references. The mouthfeel is soft and of course, there's more to taste than to smell. But, this isn't close to a hop bomb, nor a malty IPA. What's there comes through at the finish in a combination of distant pine and fruit references. The body is supple and soft, with the alcohol nearly undetectable.

It's funkier than I imagined, with a uniquely soft brie that fills the nose before accenting touches of buttery white wine and nutty oak develop. The palate crisps it up with tart pear and slightly overripe and dried apricot while toastier oak develops in a way that somehow conjures up honey representations. And so the pursuit comes to a conclusion, in a way such that, for me, elucidates how the biggest names in Hill's wine barrel aged saison collection are not the pinnacle in their catalogue, while still clearly have contributed to some beautiful blends, like Clover, as well as honed their experience in pursuing other expressions, like Samuel, Work's of Love (Monk's Café, Cigar City), and more. I'm just glad I no longer have to stress over which organ I'll need to give up in order to try this sucker. --- At FOFA 2025 we chose to start the opening of festivities at the 2015 Art draft station, which I think was the right choice, as it seemed even better than the version we had in 2023, though I won't change my current rating. An oaky nose gave way to an apricotty taste in a crisply tart yet rounded, bubbly body that finished finely paper dry. A touch of pear and hint of strawberry accented the perfect acidity. It was just so zippy and bright, it was like a spritzer damn near champagne. All in all, this actually sounds quite parallel to my initial experience with Art, though it all seemed to come with that much more clarity of expression this time around. Furthermore, after having both Ann and Art more than once at this point in my life, I can definitively say that I prefer Art significantly more, though ironically enough, before they hit barrels, I prefer Anna over Arthur.

Art,"Reviewed by M-Fox24 from New Jersey 4.49 /5 rDev -0.7% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 A: The decanter tinges vermilion on the initial impact, which transfers to a vivid – metallic – orange. That luminosity tops a deep saffron base with a pastel orange hue, as gamboge tones streak throughout. Proportionately, an askew cap that comes to a vista white inch, while steadily downsizing to the ½ in, where the palette succumbs a snow drift highlight. The configuration has the hydrophobic polypeptides & bitter acids to modestly cling, when retreating to the ¼ in. At this point, a latticework with a residual nuance to dimly stick, as the retention retains an enacting solidity. Albeit, shy on the aesthetic decree, seeing the descending collar to the minute. The layouts have a transparency upon the transfers, which have an opulent appeal early on, while a circuitous convention develops amid the pressing radiations S: A density set to esters, as they constantly web around the oak casks, while the grain bill pitches a smart rusticity. There is an isoamyl octanoate innuendo near the persuasive peach accompaniments, which takes a Torani Syrup form. In this respect, a softly tart & fuzzy recording that’s lightly backed, by the oak tannin exchanges, while the hop effect lends a floral regularity. The phenolic compounds gradually characterize on cobwebs, aside a ripened mustiness, given the vintage works over the decant. However, a narrow presentation on the inaugurating course, as the directive is more symphonic to the seeds and skins above the alluding crops. The advancements have a stronger denotation on the aged strains with a grain bill that ties in pit + trench silos, while maintaining a profitable presence on esters.  Markedly, a harmonization amongst the ranching & pastoral foregrounds to the milder fruits ascribing pears, berries, and apricots. Moreover, an undercroft ease on the °F upticks, while a dry Torrontés similitude dispatches, besides the barrel aldehydes. The cessations retain an earthed ruralism against the – loitering – eugenol structures, beyond the leathery tannin constitutes T: Fermentable complexities with a soft cask neatness, which traits ethyl acetates to porous oak codas. Namely, an oxidized kindliness that has a solvent growth under fresh clingstone peaches, which impute seedy connotations per the inferred pits. The French oak barrel offers mild spices to complex polymers, where phenolic aldehydes pitch vanillin. Meanwhile, malt backs the bready accounts with Dorset knobs & pie crusts, as hops back a longleaf pine essence, while ketones casually mingle. Chiefly, an inducement on raspberry ketones alongside strawberries & melons, before connoting emerald drop pluots. A buildout on fleshed fruit to palm syrup, as catacomb dust delicately descends on Golden Silk Spiders. Coupled with, cattle yard atmospheres to leathery tannins, as a transferred aridity elevates above the rustic granularities. The timing to weather – over the course – reverberates that inaugurating solvency thru an Oloroso Sherry implementation, which offers an oxidative nuttiness to exotic thickets. On the rear side, a perceptible murmur on cloves & nutmeg, while guaiacols quietly coat the codicils over smoke, as polyphenol compounds dictate M: There is a passing rain to flagstone texture, from a minerality component that later transcends on seafronts. The surface is soft with calm acidic natures, given the modest vivacities, which attenuate steadily. In consequence, a dry formation that benefits over the cask scriptures, when depicting the hydrolysable substances O: Yeast grandiosities that are perceptively backed across the bitter – earthy – hop effects, while phenolic companions lurk. On balance, a sensitive malt mannerism with a loyal intention to not annihilate the course, as the French oak barrels impress. The timetables are advantageous to the vintage over an improved dryness, from cut sugars to cranked up/interconnected esters Dec 23, 2022 Report",4.49

Let's pop it open and see what it's all about Pours an opaque reddish purple with a finger of pinkish white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing The nose is actually rather subdued surprisingly. I'm picking up on aromas of tart cherry, lemon juice, sharp oak, brown sugar, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and graham cracker Things liven up much more in taste, amping up both the tartness and the sweetness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart cherry, sharp oak, cranberry, brown sugar, tannic red wine, wet hay, lemon zest, old leather, and light raspberry. The swallow brings notes of tart cherry, graham cracker, tannic red wine, sharp oak, old leather, toasted walnut, vanilla, jammy raspberry, lemon juice, and wildflower honey A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer.

Aroma of sour funk (leather) and oak, with a background of tart cherries. Taste is layered for both depth and length. Initial cherry flavor is rather sweet but then turns tart. Oak throughout. Earthy funk. Brief appearance of spice, with a longer interval of vanilla. Sweet and tart in the aftertaste, which fades away rather slowly. Medium mouth feel, with a touch of syrup. Some drying in the finish but not a tooth scraper. The cherries taste really fresh and expand the flavors beyond the base sour ale.

S: Immediate, cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. There is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal. T: Surprisingly subdued, it is sour,  but not brutally so, and the cherry is certainly there but I got some baking spice, what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . There are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins. M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry. O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. Fruited Sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not, but I will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here, I would be more inclined to buy them.

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"Reviewed by SierraNevallagash from Maine 4.44 /5 rDev -1.6% look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 Unbelievably huge thanks to Anthony for this massive want of mine. Very excited. 500ml bottle - b6 (Feb. '19) poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F. Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen. Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake. Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish. Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry. Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class. Apr 06, 2020 Report",4.44

Because I think this could be a touch sweeter upfront, I was a little underwhelmed at first. After it warmed and opened up, however, I started appreciating it a bit more. Pretty good...

As with many hazies, this doesn't punch the nose, but it is pleasant. There's a pleasant starchy backing for resinous hops, which aren't at all that bitter to smell. There's a near perfect softness to the mouthfeel, just like a hazy styled AIPA should provide. Unlike too many others, it's neither too thin, nor too sticky. The same goes for the hopping. It, too, is close to perfect for the style. It's vaguely resinous, with a hint of a spice like lemongrass, coriander or pepper. With some nice glass lacing, this also looks close to perfect. Overall, this is one incredibly good beer. Outside of New England, this is a rare find. When it shows, beer geeks are on their phones to their buddies and it doesn't last long.

The highest rated American IPA on BA!! I’ve been wanting to try this one for quite some time, and I’m thrilled to finally get the opportunity to. I’ve been seeing more Hill Farmstead beers near me as time goes on, and I’m excited by all of it. Let’s see if it can truly live up to the hype Pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing The nose is somewhat delicate, for lack of a better word, but still shows an excellent balance of all of its elements that ends up turning out really nice. I'm picking up on aromas of orange zest, pine sap, bready malt, grassy hops, honey, pineapple juice, white pepper, grapefruit zest, and light orange marmalade In taste it falls a little bit flat of the complexity on display in the aroma, not exactly one-dimensional but more focused on bitterness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting grapefruit zest, piney hops, bready malt, weed, white pepper, honey, light passionfruit, and pineapple. The swallow brings notes of crackery malt, white pepper, piney hops, fresh cut grass, honey, grapefruit zest, passionfruit, and light orange A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness While I think this is quite good, it's nothing mind blowing. There's better examples of the style out there, but I'd also like to try this fresher one day, as I've heard HF can be really particular about the best by dates on their IPAs Jan 07, 2023 Report",4.34

I actually do not think it's because of age, just my palate being a little different when I did this review. That aside, this is still a very good IPA, especially if I am patient enough to let it warm to the proper temperature from my cold fridge.  The look is a quite highly hazed, near but not 100% opaque.  As with many HF beers, the head and lacing are pretty strong. Nose is a mix of tangerine, grapefruit, and some form of sweet fruit - I want to say a little pineapple.  There's a light herbal note that comes somewhat as a muted mint to me, but is definitively a foreshadowing of some form of bitterness in the taste. Medium heft, maybe a little less, with a prickly carbonation biting through the softer edges.  More citrus rind and fruit - tangerine, orange, and some sweet ruby grapefruit, with a little huskiness from the barley and/or other grains.  Not really any of the tropical fruit accent from the nose.  The back end is bitter, but it has an interesting sheen of maltiness to it.  Bittersweet leaning heavily on the first part, the latter keeps things from getting out of hand.  As expected, a well constructed brew that brings both malt and hop to the experience.

For one, I had it at one of my first visits to any brewery since moving to San Diego. But it is also an amazing brew. To the eye it looks like a somewhat intense stout, with a brown foam and a thick body, but not too oily. The aroma is big and bold, and cold and saturnine, like the smell of cold metal, but with some cacao nibs on the edge. The flavor is the real appeal here. Creamy, rich but not cloying, it is decadent, and deserving. Huge gushing chocolate notes combine with deluxe and top-shelf coffee notes, like Bird Rock coffee. Better yet, this beer gets spicier as it warms, like a Christmas ale, and reveals shades of nutmeg and cinnamon. Could this be a rare 10 for flavor?! Jun 24, 2019 Report",4.37

It’s pitch black and forms a two finger, creamy, thick, dark mocha colored crown. The crown holds well and leaves lacing. It would be hard for this to look much better. The nose brings roasty, dark malts more so than roasty coffee. However, there is a coffee presence. It also brings a bitterness to it that resembles bitter bakers chocolate; dark chocolate. A smooth cream note wants to show, but hardly does. Almost an earthy, peat like note? The taste brings in a cream presence along with those roasty, slightly burnt malts. Bitter, dark chocolate still showing. A black pepper like spice shows up at the end, along with a little bit of an earthy wood/smoke presence. The mouthfeel is creamy underneath that black pepper and light earthy smoke presence. Hardly any sign of the 12% ABV, which is impressive. It does show a bitterness all the way through. I would say the body is on the light side of full bodied, thick and creamy but not fudge like. Overall, while this wasn’t bad, I’ve got to admit I did expect more from it. Mar 29, 2019 Report",4.05

Appearance:  medium golden-yellow hue with plenty of haze and a finger of frothy ivory foam. Smell:  sweet malt with an excellent tropical, fruity, juicy, orange-Julius-ey aroma.  I am enticed, intrigued, and enraptured. Taste:  a little bit earthier and danker than the aroma, but still with an excellent tropical fruit character.  Really, really, good. Mouthfeel:  medium body with a good carbonation and creaminess. Overall:  while there is some complexity to this beer, it doesn't have the depth, say, of a rich barleywine or Belgian quad.  That said, the depth this beer possesses is in a flavor zone that really appeals to me.  Flavor Flav says don't believe the hype, but in this case, I think it's warranted.  Outstanding beer.

Poured into an Other Half snulip glass.  It pours an opaque, bright, dirty tangerine color with almost a finger of fluffy, milk-white head and thick, clinging lacing. Lots of lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, and pineapple on the nose along with floral hops. There is a good balance of sweet and tart citrus, including the aforementioned lemon, grapefruit, orange/tangerine, and pineapple, and notes of ripe melon but the malt provides a rich, earthy backdrop from the oats and wheat.  Others have commented on the hop burn but I find the bitterness to be clean and manageable. The mouth feel is terrific:  rich and fluffy with appropriate carbonation, and the 8.5% ABV gives it good substance without overpowering. Overall, I have a feeling that this can is past its prime.

Been sitting on it for a bit, and decided it would be an excellent Valentine for myself. Poured into a snifter, it was the color of the mood of Philadelphia Eagles fans right now. Virtually no head besides a very thin line of tan bubbles around the rim. Not a great looking beer, but it's not surprising considering how strong it is. As expected, it smells like a big Stout brewed with the adjunct ingredients of vanilla and bourbon barrels, with an unexpected touch of what smells like Graham crackers. Smells like a luscious dessert. Tastes like it smells, but better. It's not a subtle beer, but you don't drink beers like this for subtlety. The bourbon Barrel flavor is fairly mellow and refined, and the vanilla is at a level that melts well with that, unlike a lot of beers I've had with vanilla added to it. That Graham crackery thing I noticed in the nose is present in the taste as well. I do not believe any graham crackers were abused in the making of this beer, perhaps it's a byproduct of the vanilla and bourbon mixing. It is utterly delicious, that's for sure. Fairly creamy mouth feel, body is somewhere between medium and full. This is a glorious dessert beer. Perhaps also my last from Modern Times. But, hey, they're going out on a high note with me.

This has a nearly perfect vanilla aroma to it, just so authentic, decadent, but not overly cloying, with dark chocolate, bourbon, dried black cherry, and coffee. The vanilla treatment here is nearly perfect - reminds me of something like Vanilla Rye in its prime (not now). It's got that cake-like sweetness with a touch of dried cherry, just super authentic and not at all artificial. The base stout is super chocolatey, with some roast and a touch of coffee like bitterness, with some caramel and oak on top of it from the barrel. This is thick bodied, sweet, decadent, but not overly so, with no booziness, and a very creamy smooth finish.

I’m in my basement drinking. The world might be ending. It’s surreal. About to pop a 22 oz. beer rec’d from ICTM & split it with my wife. Black beer with virtually no head with a nose of chocolate & vanilla. I like it. Modem Tones – Bourbon Barrel Aged & Vanilla is true to its name. Vanilla heavy, this is like being wrapped in vanilla orchids & partially drowned in 100% vanilla stuff. Mid-palate, cleared by the vanilla fist, is a sharp sting of bourbon with a subtle undercurrent of cocoa nibs. Stand-a-spoon-up-in-it thick. But drinkable. Oh, so, drinkable. One might ask why there aren’t sixteen adjuncts in this & the answer is: not necessary. The vanilla plays off the barrel like Pacino & De Niro chewing the scenery to mulch. Excellent beer.

M: A touch on the fuller side of medium body, slightly prickly moderate carbonation, yet creamy smooth. O: I had this one for the first time last year and was so utterly underwhelmed that I figured it was an off batch or something must have happened to it in transit. No way could my experience be so far off from such a normally highly regarded beer, so I vowed to give it a second chance as soon as I saw it again. Really glad I decided to give it another chance, this can is completely different experience and much more along the lines of what everyone else has said about it. There's still a bit of a herbal earthy tone that I'm not in love with that is holding me back from scoring it higher, but it is significantly less pronounced than it was in my previous can. My overall impression: They pulled just about everything there is to pull from Mosaic hops and paired it with a ridiculously smooth malt base. I wouldn't mind the earthy herbal side being minimized a bit more, but I'd happily buy this one again. Jun 23, 2023 Report",4.28

The beer has a three finger tall dense sudsy foamy white head that reduces to a handful of small patches of thin film surrounded by a large patch of mottled very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass.

That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of citrus/orange zest + citrus/tangerine + tropical/pineapple + melon/cantaloupe + herbal + pine/resinous hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which fades away fairly quickly leaving moderate lingering tropical + citrus + herbal hops flavors. M: Light to medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly crisp upfront with a moderate amount of soft/fluffiness mid-body and a light amount of dryness in the finish.

Ultra-light but standard ipa pale malt base is inoculated nicely with an NEIPA yeast strain that provides a touch of stone fruit flavor.  Hop additions provide a nice orange and melon flavor injection.  Finishes with a nice pine and rind bitterness; 7/10 on my scale. Mouthfeel is near perfection, ultra-light and refreshing. Overall a fantastic NEIPA, definitely amongst the best i have had! Oct 11, 2022 Report",4.69

It has a nice dry finish with bitter tart fruit. It's not overly juicy, but I'm assuming that's not the goal here either. A great beer!

Enjoyed fresh. Appearance: Pours a hazy golden-orange with a dense, frothy white head that sticks around and leaves thick lacing. It’s glowing and opaque—quintessential Trillium haze. Looks juicy and rich, like a freshly blended tropical smoothie. Aroma: Massive hop aroma up front—Mosaic doing what it does best. Blueberry, mango, and citrus oils dominate with a subtle dankness underneath. There’s also a touch of pine resin, light peach skin, and green melon. Super fresh and punchy, with depth. Taste: Bold and juicy with waves of mango, citrus peel, pineapple, and underripe blueberry. There’s a gentle green hop bite mid-palate and a light herbal note on the finish. Balanced sweetness from the malt—lightly honeyed and bready—but the hops clearly lead. The dry hop adds a concentrated fruit punch with just enough bitterness to keep it grounded. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a smooth, almost creamy texture. Moderate carbonation gives it a soft lift without being overbearing. Juicy throughout with a slightly dry, resinous finish that invites the next sip. Overall: An excellent Mosaic-forward IPA that blends intensity with balance. The dry hopping elevates the fruit character while keeping things clean and drinkable. It’s vibrant, aromatic, and unmistakably Trillium. A standout version of Fort Point for Mosaic lovers.

With that being said, I wasn't sure why this was rated so high. Maybe it's the name on the label or the nature of the hopping but overall, this was an average beer that didn't stand out in any particular way to me, even if there was hardly any sediment from it being in my basement for all this time... Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a deep apricot with enough fluffy head to top it off. Quite cloudy, only a bit of sediment floated in it and hardly any light got in around the edges. Very little soapy lacing was seen along the back of my pint glass as I worked my way through this, which was a bit of a surprise. Loads of Mosaic, dankness, grass, and forest in the muted nose as they all came through in the taste. Nothing heavy here and the Barley stood out more than anything else in the taste, as this felt quite full but uninspiring at the same time. A lack of easily discernible bitterness stood out to me as this went right down and although it wasn't bad, it needed quite a bit more to stand out from Trillium's other offerings that I've had. Not a lot of booze here either as this was the epitome of what a generic American Pale Ale is, in my eyes. I need to get a fresh can of this but given how well their other offerings have held up well over time, this one was  a bit of a letdown. I prefer the regular Fort Point and know that it's me, and not them, when it comes to how low I rated this. Needs another go before I fully write it off! Mar 21, 2019 Report",3.78

Always bring back Trillium when you visit Boston! Like you didn’t know that. 16 oz. can dated 10/4/18. The pour is thick, phlegm-like yellow that smells like grapefruit perfume cut with pine. Not bad. Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point leans hard enough into grapefruit it might fall out of the car. Grapefruit for kilometers, kiwi, spring florals, touch of mint, with a nice bitter finish. Dry. Easy enough to drink, which might be its calling card. I can’t speak for the masses (but I will anyways), but this appears to be a classic case of “this is Trillllllium!”-itis. A good, solid beer, but nothing to rise above many others, especially with all the genuinely excellent beers in their portfolio. Nov 10, 2018 Report",

On the nose, heavy mettle has green stonefruit and has a strong note of pineapple  juice and a hint of pine and mint. On the pallate, we get a huge hit of pine turpines and pineapple juiciness that progresses into a creamy orange with a note of mango before a bitter hop bite. Mouthfeel is rather light, with med-light carbonation and a heafy finish of ABV that reminds you how boozy this brew really is.

Very mild cracker malt backbone. Barely shows up and is overwhelmed by the fruit, weed, and grass presence. Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied for a NEIPA. Mild carbonation.

Pours a turbid, nearly milky, delightfully glowing pale orange hue, topped with a very short head that quickly recedes to a thin film and collar. A small swirl deposits some scant lacing along the glass. Nose: The aroma is bursting with ripe, succulent citrus aromas - orange juice, pomello, and grapefruit - along with a big bouquet of ripe tropical and stone fruits. Lots of mango, some guava, pineapple, and a hint of papaya, with secondary notes of kiwifruit, strawberry, blueberry, coconut, lychee, peach, nectarine, and a remarkably sweet, exotic fruity element that I simply cannot place. The aroma is completely saturated, sweet, and fruity, and bears no earthy, musty, or funky components. Palate: The beer greets the palate with a forceful, sugary sweetness, which is to be expected from a dry-hopped beer of this calibre. It isn't a starchy, malty sweetness, but rather a concentrated fructose sweetness, like ripe tropical fruit. Speaking of ripe tropical fruit, the flavour is bursting with ripe mango, pineapple, papaya, and overripe peach, the latter being very indicative of the Galaxy hops that are crammed into this. There are some bright, juicy, slightly acidic notes of orange juice and grapefruit, which highly compliment the pineapple notes, and also help to cut through some of the sweetness. Much of this acidity is presumably hop burn, though it's restrained enough to be enjoyable, adding a layer of complexity rather than being detrimental to the beer itself. There is just a touch of earthy dankness which is also to be expected from a bill containing any amount of Galaxy. I suspect the grist contains a measurable amount of oat, as the malt is clean, fairly neutral, and possesses practically zero graininess. The finish is quite fruity and floral, before the sweetness gently subsides, allowing just a touch of resinous bitterness to peek through at the very end, before lifting off, leaving a clean, oaty dryness and a whisper of peach lingering. Mouthfeel/Body: It's a big, bold, dry hopped New England double IPA clocking in at 9.3% ABV, AND it's from Trillium. Anyone who has had a big Trillium IPA can imaging that this beer is just one massively fluffy hoppy pillow. The beer is soft, fluffy, creamy, and velvety smooth, yet still possesses enough effervescence to lend texture and cut through some of the heft. Nevertheless, this is a very stout beer, and is by no means a midday summer refresher. While the flavour profile would allow this to pair nicely with food, I think the sheer weight of it may prevent it from being the ideal mean accompaniment. Also bear in mind that aside from the heft of this beer, it shows little-to-no evidence of it's ABV, which could make this a dangerous little creeper. Overall: For what this beer is, it's hard to find much, if anything wrong with it. It's a wonderfully fruity, sweet, succulent double (verging on triple) IPA crafted with the trademark uniqueness that has made Trillium a cult classic. It embodies everything the brewery is known for, from its top-tier hops, to the pillowy mouthfeel, all packed into a whopper of a beer, that's easy and enjoyable to drink. A true hoppy cornerstone of the Trillium lineup. Nov 19, 2019 Report",4.51

Heavy Mettle,"Reviewed by JerzDevl2000 from New Jersey 4 /5 rDev -11.1% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4 Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/15/17 with ""EW-WAM-AM-AH"" written below that. I don't know what that means or if that is a heavy metal reference but I can honesty say that this was a typical Trillium beer that had all of their attributes present in it, including an easy sense of enjoyment to it throughout my session! Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a muted honey with enough off to offset the the cloudy, dull liquid even though that settled relatively quickly. Only a few spots of lacing was left behind as I worked my way through this as the residue on the side of my pint glass was quite disappointing. Tons of mango, citrus rind, booze, and yeast filled the nose although they were quite muted  from the first whiff onward. Dank, pithy, and strong, tons of melon, cantaloupe, and kiwi came through as this warmed up but it was never easygoing enough for me to fully embrace. This had a creaminess and slickness to it that saved it from being a disappointment but it needed more sugar and tangerine from feeling too heavy, as the carbonation was nearly nowhere to be found... No doubt that this had enough alcohol to it and it seemed to complement the subtle hop burn quite well. That wasn't what I was looking for as this beer put the ""heavy"" into heavy mettle. Tons of Galaxy hops ensured that this would be a dank hop bomb but in the end, this needed it's rough edges rounded out a bit. Worth a go for those who love Trillium but this didn't match up with their better, and more popular offerings... Mar 06, 2019 Report",

I am rolling into 2400 reviews, which I thought I would not achieve when I started almost 19 years ago. I am serving it at 42 degrees in a tulip glass. The pour created a half-fingered, white head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left a ring around the glass. The color is golden yellow with a light amber hue. It is transparent and charting at SRM 6. Overall, it has an average appearance for a gueze. Nosing the glass, I smell grass, honey, a floral bouquet, a light toasted bread crust, malty sweetness, a light funky barn, earthiness, grassy oak, apricots, pears, light phenols, apple cider, and mineral water (like calcium). Sipping the glass, I taste pears, apricot, funky barn, floral esters, light phenols, lightly toasted bread crust, crackers, a skosh of malty sweetness, minerals(mainly calcium/limestone), apple cider, light horse blanket, honey, grassy, and a touch of herbal. The mouthfeel is tannic and finishes dry and crisp. The body is light and has high carbonation. I was unsure what to expect with this beer, a typical Gueze. I am sipping a complex Gueze with many flavors melding together, creating depth and complexity. Cresting 2400, I look back to see that not all beers are created equal. Often, the depth and complexity added to the overall dimension of the beer is what makes it amazing or meh. This beer is something special. I hope to find more intriguing beers.

Poured from a bottle (11Feb2020 - no 37 - 19|20) into a geuze glass L: pours a turbid, darker orange yellow with a moderate, crackling white head. Moderate visible carbonation feeding the minimal head. Think I stirred the lees moving the bottle from the fridge, my bad. Second glass, while still turbid, is notably less so - more of a brighter, golden yellow. Some chunky lacing left with each sip S: that classic, seductive 3F geuze nose. Pleasant bit of barnyard funk to open, with some bright fruit notes quickly behind. Slight cheese, assertively but appropriately acidic - on the fruit front, granny smith apple, bit of lemon flesh, some white peach. Some chardonnay grape as well. Great mix of bright fruit and complex, earthy funk T: great swallow, delivers a nice mix of fruit and sour with bright acidity. Slight pucker at first with notes of green apple, bright and pronounced citrus. That lemon flesh character from the nose comes through well here, pleasantly sharp and leads into the medium-long finish. That more cheesy barnyard funk is more toward the finish, leaves this great lingering note with a rustic baked bread flavor as well. Flavor dances nicely in that unique way, really nice F: medium- body, medium+ carbonation. Nicely drying, that bit of tart that suggests a nice sip O: wonderful and tasty geuze.

A medium hued peach in color with nice carbonation and lacing that stays around. I don't get as much off the nose as I would like while it's cold but the flavors jump out more on the tongue thankfully. As it warmed the lambic funk started to come through. There's so much happening flavor wise here. Tartness is medium to medium high. I wish there were a bit more funk but it's present. It recognizable as a 3 Fonteinen beer immediately to me.

What truly stands out to me about this blend is that it's quite absent the typical apples that define many geuzes - the tart and sour notes are far more present, and the beer doesn't have quite the same body. Lots of oak notes dominate as well. It's funky, but only lightly so. Quite a terrific beer. I'm not sure that I'd rate it significantly superior to Drie Fonteinen's standard Oude Geuze though (that being said, I absolutely adore the standard geuze... it amazes me that it's a shelfie in certain parts of the country).

I am using a tulip glass and serving the beer at 44 degrees. The pour created an airy, foamy, half-fingered head with no retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The color is a murky, reddish-brown with no clarity. The beer does not look appetizing at all. I will give this overall appearance a 4, with some skepticism. Nosing the beer, I detect cherries, raspberries, lightly toasted malts, earthiness, barnyard funk, acidic acid, lemons, and a light yeasty note. Lemons, berries, cherries, light toasted malts, acidic notes, barnyard funk, earthiness, a hint of phenol, wood, and leather dominate the first sip. The mouthfeel is mouth-puckering sour, finishing crisp. The body is light and has low carbonation. Final Thought: The beer has a sour component that is not for the faint of heart, coupled with its low carbonation, which took me by surprise. The beer is not the prettiest to look at, but it is complex. The fruit component is tarty and fresh, adding the much-needed subtle sweetness to help balance this beer out. The more I sipped on it, the more I noticed an odd flavor that had a funky horse blanket vibe mixed with old wood — a unique beer, for sure. Aug 24, 2025 Report",4.38

Pours a clear pink color (at least until reaching the plentiful sediment lower in the bottle) with a quickly fading head. Aroma and flavor feature bracing acidity, sharp oak tannins, leather funk, background malt, no hops to speak of, and a surprising amount of bright raspberry flavor.

But I guess I missed that milestone. Poured into my cascade 8 oz glass. Body is a vibrant ruby red to dark pink color. Pours absolutely flat with no head. Nose is of an authentic Belgian lambic.  Cheesecloth, oak barrel,vinegar, and Belgian funk.  There is a soft raspberry background. Overall the nose is soft vs pungent and I'm not getting any cherry. With the initial flavor the sour aspects from the lambic hit hard. There is a lot of sour cherry there. There are vinegar overtones that accent the sour flavor. The sour raspberry comes through for the finish and the sour fades temporarily and fresh fruity and juicy raspberry comes through along with a woodieness from the barrel. Left to linger long is a little bit of everything I just described. The feel is somewhat thin and vineagary. The carbonation is present but very soft which is welcoming considering the consistency of the liquid and the sour punch the flavor packs. Overall this is a fantastic classic Belgian lambic made like only the best Belgian breweries can make. I've been looking forward to this one for awhile and I am very happy I got to try it. Very classy. My only slight gripe is in the consistency of the mouthfeel- otherwise this is one of my favorite fruit lambics. Jul 17, 2024 Report",4.27

Pretty classic for the style, but still its slow going.  That acidity takes over to much. I love 3 Fonteinen, and this is a good example of the style for sure.  Though it is unbalanced for me.  There are other Fruit Lambic's that I prefer over this, but still you have to acknowledge that this is exactly what they wanted to make, and I do enjoy it.

Hommage,"Reviewed by Roguer from Connecticut 4.61 /5 rDev +2.4% look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75 Two year old bottle. Beautiful strawberry color in the glass, completely transparent if decanted - darker and murkier with the yeast, however, nearly completely opaque. I prefer my yeast be included in my Belgians (for health, of course), but I'm not holding that against the appearance score. Pale pink fizzy head, brief lived, leaving the body completely still. Extraordinary nose: tart and fruity, but equally funky, earthy, and sharp. Earthy, dirty, mushroom-like funk; raspberry and cherry; oak and must; a great example of the oft-mocked ""horse blanket."" The palate has less earthy funk, but it's still there, especially on the back half. Up front, it's a blend of the sharp tartness of the berries and a light white wine vinegar-like sourness. Cherry skins and raspberry on the back third and finish. Strongly sour, more in line with many American takes on sours and wild ales than most Belgian Lambics, owing at least in part to the sharpness of the berries. Mouth puckering; lingering sourness about the gums. Swishing, swirling, and chewing is almost dangerous. There's no vinegar burn, however. This is world class, but if more of the funkiness translated to the palate and cut through the sourness, it would be among the best beers I've ever had. As it is, it's easily one of the best fruited Lambics in the world, different in character from Cantillon, but just as good. Perhaps the funk becomes more pronounced with age.

Aroma is huge sourness, tart lactic acidity, with a prominent minerality and plastic like funk notes. Tons of fruit notes as well with huge raspberry, nearly as big cherry, and even some strawberry notes (although I know there’s no strawberries in it). Just an absolutely wonderful aroma.  Taste is just an insanely huge puckering sourness.  This is easily amongst the most sour beers I’ve ever had and I love that.  Fruit notes balance wonderfully with both sour and sweet and raspberry and cherry.  Some clean mineral drying characters, moderate oakiness, essentially no pungeant funk notes but rather all sour/tart characters; which again I love. Carbonation is actually quite low, I think it’s fair to say undercarbed, although the puckering tartness and drying finish make that low carbonation affect the product less than it otherwise would.  Drinkability is excellent and I wish I had more of this. Overall just a wonderful beer. 3.75/4.75/4.75/4/4.5 Feb 08, 2021 Report",4.57

Saison Bernice,"Reviewed by cjgiant from District of Columbia 4.16 /5 rDev -7.6% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4 On tap: Glass comes to me with a medium dark golden beer in it, clear enough to see multiple carbonation streams feeding a medium-ish collar and a whispy island.  Nose on a cold beer shows a little honey malt but mainly an apple cider vinegar tanginess from the yeast choice.  First sip is a little more bitter than the second, as my palate adjusts to the beer.  The sour is more up front once this happens. The nose becomes a bit more complex as I continue to nose and taste.  I’m getting a light hint of mint or maybe Thai basil, sour peach, and lime zest the deeper I get.  The taste changes level off, with a neutral opening turning citrus pith bitter briefly before the vinegar and lemon/lime sour notes take over. This beer is coming more tart and sour than funky.  Medium light with a tingly feel from the combined attack of carbonation and sourness.  I’d like a bit more nuance in the taste to match interesting nose. Nov 16, 2024 Report",4.16

Notes of grass and green apples were also present. The funk balanced the fruit flavors, making for a well-balanced version of the style. Mouthfeel - The viscosity allowed the profile to stick to the tongue and roof of the mouth, even with high carbonation. Overall - I may have a new favorite saison. Oct 27, 2023 Report",4.79

Nearly clear Arylide yellow body with a steady stream of micro-bubbles. Off white cap disappears rapidly. Almost no lacing, nor legs. Subtle complex yeast-driven aromatics suffused with poolish, fresh cut hay, and stone fruit. Floral, with a whisper of white wine/champagne. Bright with a balance of light grain/malt, tart meyer lemon/unripe pear, and a faint peppery/barnyard edge from the Brett. Light clean bitterness with a touch of alfalfa and clover. Long, medium-dry finish reveals full maturation and synergy of ingredients. A bit thin and fizzy with lingering acidity. What meager roundness is present seems almost (but not quite) chalky. Excellent aroma and flavor, a core expression from the brewery, but the body is more like a lambic than a saison - perhaps this was not a great bottle/batch, but at the price point I'm not eager to roll the dice again right away.

Saison Bernice,"Reviewed by SierraNevallagash from Maine 4.41 /5 rDev -2% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Huge thanks to Steve for this one. This has been on my radar for quite some time. 750ml bottle (vintage??) Poured into a classic tulip. Refrigerated for 5 days - allowed to warm up for 10 minutes. Pours a brilliant honey straw golden colour, topped with a quick-to-dissipate finger of off white head. Excellent unfiltered clarity, and plenty of visible effervescence rising up to creating a sparkling top. Minimal lacing after swirling. Nose: Rustic saison grains, likely a good amount of wheat. Crackery. Plenty of classic saison yeast aromas of wet hay, peppery spice, green apple, a faint hint of bubblegum, a whisper of clove, some woody spices, fresh cut grass, wet wool, petrichor, some delicate farmy funk, a hint of leather, and a wonderfully restrained acidity lending a big shroud of lemon. A beautiful saison aroma. Palate: Bernice greets the palate with what is likely the most balanced acidity I've ever encountered. This is not a ""Midwest saison"" that makes you pucker up from top to bottom. A gentle tartness akin to unripe berries starts things off, while this delicate grainy sweetness follows. Beneath this sweet-tart balance are notes of lemon, apple, Bartlett pear, fresh grass, white grape, unripe berry, starfruit, fresh nectarine, white plum, a hint of phenolic black peppercorn, and dried orange peel. There is quite a bit of dusty brett, lending some light funk, wet wood, a gentle earthiness, fermenting stone fruit, and a gentle peach pit bitterness. There are subtle grassy floral notes from some very restrained hopping, which is greatly appreciated. The finish puts particular emphasis on these grassy floral notes, along with some dusty brett funk, and a gentle black pepper bite. The ale finishes beautifully dry, with zero lingering tartness, and a gentle, clean aftertaste of cracker saison grains, with the faintest whisper of tannic fruit pits. Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-light bodied. Crisp, refreshing, and ultra snappy with the malt providing just enough body to provide a subtle softness. Effervescence is lively and fine, without being scratchy or seltzery. Gentle acidity upfront providing a balanced tartness, concluding with just the perfect degree of tannic dryness. Highly attenuated. Overall: This is maybe the perfect all-around saison. It is absolutely authentic and beautifully classic in nature, with the most balanced amount of acidity you could possibly get in an ale like this. Not puckering, but enough to just nudge this into sour ale territory. This is everything you could ask for in a saison. Authenticity, perfect grain balance, gentle tartness, excellent yeast complexity, Belgian influence, crisp, refreshing body... It's wonderful. You won't find the complexity of the heavy hitter sours in this, but if it's the perfect saison you're looking for, Bernice will take you there. Privileged to be able to drink this.

Upper Case,"Reviewed by JohnniEMc from Pennsylvania 4.23 /5 rDev -6% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25 The pour that emptied a pint can's contents into a clear glass liter mug produced that nearly stark white foam that bears witness to a wheat inclusion. The foam recedes unevenly, unattractively and in this case, slowly. The body is dull apricot-amber, approaching murky. In short, it looks like the typical modern American IPA. Thankfully, it smells much better than it looks. There's at least a sharp citrus/pine noting to the hops. A malty counterbalance, not so much. The description of the taste is basically a repeat of the words used for the smell. The 9% ABV is noticed, as it adds to the hop bite, but not as a detriment. Also, there's a little more starchy sweetness than predicted by the nose, but it's shallow. Taste references would be pineapple and lemon, backed by a good earthy hop bite. The mouthfeel is average for the style, maybe just a little better for something that carries this much alcohol. There's some stratified glass lacing that enhances its looks. Overall, for something that obviously has wheat in its wort, this isn't bad, especially for one that hits with such potency. Oct 11, 2023 Report",4.23

Actually a very similar experience to Big Bird, which I lucked into two years ago as I picked up a flat of Trillium beers in Fort Point on our way to Cape Cod for a bi-annual multi-family trip. I think this one is actually more polished and tasty, fresh, than Big Bird was. But the amazing hop experience is similar. Looks like a muddy pineapple juice, but the aromas and (to a just slightly lesser degree) flavors cover just about every hop-related note I love about hoppy beers. Citrus, pith, berries, mango, musky wine grapes, dank hemp, tropical fruit, wheat biscuit, sugared grapefruit. Absolutely phenomenal. Grassy, but not overly so, which is a nice departure from most NE IPAs. Really nice level of sweetness, as well, and zero green astringency, even fresh, which distances this beer from Big Bird. Feel is a little thin, but that doesn’t take anything away from the amazing, complex, and harmonious nose and tongue. Amazing that you can throw an ungodly amount of different hops together and get such a wonderful end result. Jul 29, 2019 Report",4.39

Magnificent. Taste - these $13 imperial stouts from Prairie never disappoint. Semi-sweet chocolate, with a hint of coffee and a very slight pepper / bourbon burn on the way down. Perfect American Imperial Stout. Feel - she got that thickness, boy. But still built very nice. Yes, the 13% alcohol hits hard and fast. Lol. Overall - outstanding brew. I’d drink this all day everyday if I could afford it. I’ve tried most of the current Prairie Artisan Ales lineup, and as long as you stay away from the Albino Rhino, you’ll never be disappointed with this brand.

The aroma is smoky anchou chili, dark roast coffee, roasted malt and dark chocolate. The taste is likewise dark roasted malt, spicy chili, rich dark chocolate, dark brewed coffee, very interesting, slightly sweet, mild bitterness, subtly spicy. The body is full, almost chewable, moderate carbonation, smooth as velvet, well hidden ABV and dangerously drinkable.

Appearance is opaque darkest brown you can get without being black. Very brief dark brown fizz on top like pouring a soda pop...not really a 'head'. Aroma is roasted coffee, toasted malts, dark chocolate, some molasses notes. Taste follows the nose very chocolatey, roasted coffee, some vanilla in there, very faint pepper, some booze, brown sugar, sweet but balanced with the boozy warmth, some backend hops, and the slight spice of the peppers....certainly not overpowering. Mouthfeel is wonderful. Smooth, creamy, velvety,and full. Again, some warming going on for the 13%  but not picking up any alcohol flavor...nicely hidden. Good chewiness to it, lingers around d on the palette. Overall this is a decadent craft beer. Not your session chugging beer....this is a big beer worth the time to sip and savor. At 10$ a bottle it was a nice treat but not something I would purchase weekly at that price point. Though I would get this again as a treat for sure. Jan 17, 2025 Report",4.39

The combination of peppers and vanilla feels mismatched in this stout, creating a flavor profile that doesn’t fully harmonize. The coffee notes dominate, overshadowing the chocolate and upsetting the balance between the two. While the aroma is inviting and the appearance is visually stunning, the taste doesn’t quite live up to those initial impressions. On the positive side, the mouthfeel is luxurious—rich, bold, and velvety smooth, making it an enjoyable drink overall. However, it doesn’t quite reach the level of a truly world-class beer.

In this style it is so hard to hide the alcohol content. Prairie does this well. Slight chili taste in the end keeps it from tasting too sweet. Also stands apart because of the carbonation.

The beer pours a nice golden color, honey hues, light ambers with a slight haze, and a foamy white head that offers modest retention and some spotted lacing. The aroma is great, lots of candied hop, very earthy and piney, some brighter stone fruits emerge, soft grains, chewy oak, lots of wine character, very floral and a nice funkiness. The flavors are very good, lots of candied hop, green, citrusy, grassy, offers a nice herbal earthiness, the funk really draws out the fruit character of the beer, lots of white grape and peach, vinous oak barrel,  pine, pale grain and lingering mineral water.

Smell is hay, straw, wild herbs and orchard fruits with a touch of toasted oak and a hint of lime rind. Taste is grassy hay, lemon and apple, with more brett forward funk and bitterness than regular. Tart and crisp with a tingly semi-dry swallow, a touch of woodiness comes out on the exhale. Overall very well balanced and extremely drinkable. This isn't the drastic transformation from the base that other barrel aged Hill saisons are, and it's barely more tart. Considering Dorothy is a stellar beer in its own right, I'm still very satisfied with this sip of sunlight on this uncharacteristically sunny Northeast Ohio day. --- A revisit of this in October of 2023 found more of a cheesy lactic oak expression before beautifully floral apricot opens up in the medium-light but fluffy body, almost shifting to passion fruit. This is all within a wonderfully balanced acidity, that becomes especially apparent after having a bottle of Tete just afterwards. This particular batch was so good that I'm very confidently increasing my score quite substantially, up from a 4.17. After digging through Untappd, I finally found this bottle to be batch 4, though it is becoming exceedingly difficult to identify there as almost none of these releases are officially labeled with a batch number, and the labels themselves change descriptions upon each release, so Untappd users just freely create their own names instead of listing them exactly as displayed, or at least adding the actual bottle date stamped on it.

Pours a thick, hazy orange with tons of foam. Very bright and appealing in color. Aroma is spicy, bright fruits, orange and mango, with a little pine dankness. Flavor follows nose, with the predominant flavor being citrus. There's so much orange character alongside the mango as well as a good grapefruit bitterness, and it feels like SNPA with the flavors shifted to modern hazy pale ale. To clarify, it shares the same great malt backbone and clean finish, alongside exceptional drinkability, with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but instead of heavy pine and juniper/grapefruit bitterness, this beer leans towards sweeter tropical fruit and clementines. That feels like the only change. Mouthfeel is great, carbed enough to enhance bitterness and aid appeal, but not so much that I wouldn't want to drink it excessively. This one was heavily recommended, and was actually incredibly cheap in TN. I got the last 6pk on the shelf, and boy am I glad I did. It's so easy to drink but so deep in flavor I was surprised it was so low in ABV. Pseudo Sue is really great stuff, and I'm shocked to see how quickly my 6pk disappeared. I will be buying more as soon as I can find it. Apr 12, 2025 Report",4.69

L: The beer is hazy to the point of opaque with a light sunset yellow hue in the glass.  There's a frothy, bright-white, long-lasting head.  A multitude of bubbles can be seen along the edges of the glass.  If not for the head, at a distance, I'd have thought I was drinking fruit juice. S: The aroma is the usual hazy pale ale tropical, slightly dank, citrus melange, with pineapple, mango and guava standing out. T: The taste, as is often the case with these beers, closely mirrors the nose, with an alcoholic fruit punch vibe. Pine, mango, and orange come to the fore, but I could pick a heap of other fruits if I thought long and hard enough.  There's warmth on the way down, and given that the beer is only 5.8% ABV, I'm assuming that's the hop load talking.  There's the slightest bite of shampoo in the aftertaste, but it enhances the overall experience rather than detracts. M: The mouthfeel is full and soft, like a hazy should be, and carbonation is mild and sherbety. O: This is very nice, and it's a credit to the brewer that I'm drinking it on the other side of the world eight months after I bought it, and there's still a vigorous, tropical aroma and hoppy bite on the swallow.

The beer is a bright hazy orange color, murky and opaque, topped with a 2 finger fizzy off-white head. I am thinking I will need to fight comparisons to King Sue, but for the appearance, it isn't as ""milky"" as I would have described the other beer. It is a little duller. It looks like a very hazy IPA. Smell is very strong and refreshing and apparent from some distance away, even when just opening the can. Quite tropical. Orange and citrus rind. Grapefruit juice. Pineapple, mango. Balance upon further inspection in some bready malt within. Some piney hop in the mix, but not as much as advertised or described by other reviewers, in my opinion. Taste has a bit more of the pine notes, but it also more balanced with a more malty character than anticipated. Biscuit. Honey. It is lacking some of the heat I perceived in King Sue, but that is a good thing. Smooth. Fruit again is tropical with a lot more orange and mango. Tropical notes throughout, but balanced with a dryness. Finishes with a touch of pine. Drinkable. Accessible. This is possibly a gateway beer that I would introduce others to craft with. But that being said, it is far from bland. In many ways, this is what I want most hazy IPAs to be. Balanced, refreshing, tropical, flavorful. Even (almost) sessionable. I wouldn't call it ""exciting"" (some of the best beers are not) but I would call it world-class for the style. Does exactly what you want. Jul 06, 2023 Report",4.47

I wish I could be among them, but I can't seem to show that devotion. I've reviewed 80 Wilds and only 22 did I rate above the average. (I'm usually about 62% above average, being a lenient old man.) I am a devotee of the saison, a sister style to the Wild... so go figure. Anyhow, Consecration deserves its praise. In an un-foamy style, Consecration Looks appetising (until the yeasty bottom.) Smells are a contained Wild, not too Bretty that allows the fruits to note my nose. There is substantial balance between all the elements present, but particularly a balanced Brett here.  That is not so in most Wilds. Consecration is gently tart, never sour even in the attack. Full-mouthed. Replaces two desserts, crumble and fruit cake.

Starts off with a slowly building black currant note that is joined by a range of berry-led fruit, Cabernet, and dark cherry and peaks as layers of Brett yeast come to the forefront. Tobacco, leather, oak, and wood tannings take over and the fruity and earthy interplay is extremely dialed in with both components, complimenting rather than combatting each other.

Some slow, lazy bubbles meander up, but otherwise, appears nearly still. 4.75 Nose: Right from the start, this is a balanced aroma. The base of warm, toasty, semi-sweet grain is apparent, forming a lively clean platform for the sharp characteristics. Plenty of bright dark fruit currant flair, with notes of plum, overrule cherry, prune, and even a bit of jammy red fruit. That cabernet cask is front and center, with lots of cab, and lots of cask. 4.5 Palate: Consecration hits the palate with, in typical Russian River fashion, a full on velvet assault. That is, the ale is incredibly bold and boisterous, yet it's done so with such deft balance and nuance. The wild culture acidic is so perfect - bretty and dry, with the acetic nature really softened, allowing the subtler complexities to shine. The currant is vague on the nose, but here, they distinguish themselves from other dark fruit. Tart, tangy, and tannic, which accents the microbes wonderfully. The cabernet casks, again, are just so dialed in, right there. Deep, dense, peppery wine-stained oak, complimenting those currants. Between the cultures, you get a zip from the pedio, but in the spotlight is the brett - that dusty, musty, drying tannic bitter funk - reaching a prominent but fitting peak, before letting off, and really allowing that clean, simple, semi-sweet grainy base to take over, concluding with a bit of bread crust on an exhale of intense cabernet and bretty black currant. 4.5 Mouthfeel/Body: Really lovely feel here. Yes, it's a bit on the lazy side. Not still - there's definitely some life here, but it's loose and sparse. However, at 10% ABV, it drinks exceedingly well and fluid. Not syrupy at all. Quite crisp, while still having some heft. 4.25 Overall: I think this is great. The complexity here is quite surprising. There's just a lot of depth and nuance. This seems to be a theme with RRBC wild ales, from what I've tried. This, though, captures this trifecta of complex nuance, super present wine cask and fruit character, and remarkable balance. It's a bit tannic, and packs a semi-bitter bite, but there's so much to unpack. That's just an additional layer. Just so juicy and dense. Consecration? Should be called Concentration! This one is seriously bold, intense, and bursting at the seams. A lovely bottle, and quite fitting for this Thanksgiving's pour. Well done. 4.25 Nov 24, 2022 Report",4.44

Right away, I don't see too much as to why this is so special or a top 250 beer. I've had many sours and Cab-aged sours that are similar to this. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer. Very complex and deep and the barrel is done really nice. I can be maybe this being very pioneering back in the day, so maybe it's reputation precedes it. Just don't think in 2022 this can hold a candle to some of the wild ales from HF or SARA or even Bellwoods. Recommendation: I mean, yeah, it's an RR sour from the -ation series, you gotta try it. Just don't go in expecting to get your mind blown. Hopefully the next two I have are better. May 04, 2022 Report",4.21

I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing Perhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather Oh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10% Well this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic. I could have a cellar full of this and be happy. Cheers yall Mar 13, 2022 Report",

A:  Poured into a Russian River tion glass to a deep reddish brown beer which is topped by a dense bit of pinkish white head which fades to a collar around the edge of the glass S:  Smells of a really nice amount of tartness with some red wine vinegar notes, currants, and oak along with a touch of caramel. T:  Taste is red berries and currants with some nice acidity.  Oak and red wine with some more berry fruitiness.  On the swallow there's more red berries, currants, red wine, acidity and some lingering oak. M:  This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium.  Carbonation is on the low end with a somewhat syrupy feel while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity. O:  Overall this is an outstanding dark sour.  Really nice flavors and complexity with a really nice amount of acidity to really round things out.  I wasn't sure how well this one would have held up but it's an incredible drinking experience.

Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist.  The beer is  48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present. The aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical. The flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky. The mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish.

This is top quality: a Kern/Alpine level of distilled hop intensity. Citra is dropping all the citrus you could want but its gentler side peaks out in the form of peach and melon as it goes. Then it all gets cut by chalky, old school IBUs. The truly impressive bit is the body: way lighter than you’d ever guess for 9%+, bone dry, yet silky and gracious in carrying the smooth, sustained bitterness - Warrior is a low cohumulone hop, which explains a lot.

The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent. Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal. Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank. The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers. This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing. Feb 28, 2022 Report",4.11

Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops with a little dankness, orange, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Flavor is caramel malt, citrus, piney and dank hops, grapefruit, orange, pine needles, mixed tropical fruit. Citrus rind and fresh pine finish with a deep hop bitterness that is more assertive than abrasive. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I think I would have loved this even years ago, but it is even more welcome now with all the mild, soft hopped hazy ales that are so popular now. This is what I want in an IPA: great herbal hop flavors melded to aggressive alpha oil character. And this delivers. The strong ABV brings out the flavors to a fine degree. This is close in profile to a triple IPA / American barleywine depth. The combo of pine, citrus and dankness is great. It even looks like it will pack a flavor punch. This is a legend for good reason. Although we have fine IPAs in this area, I'd buy this regularly if it was available on the market here. Jan 27, 2021 Report",

I didn't get the chance to hit Surly when I was in MN, so I'm glad we're finally seeing distro here. This one of the beers that put them on the map, and it's a throwback to the old days of in your face hoppiness. Dark golden pour with a lasting soft, foamy head. You can detect a hint of caramel malts in the aroma before the hops take over. Taste begins and ends with the hop bitterness, woody, piney, sharp. This what DIPAs used to taste like.

Some sweetness followed by an attack on the tongue and other sensory organs. Burnt mango, grapefruit pith, It's got everything, including onions and cat pee. It's weird how this is all high notes, as in shrilling piccolo. I even think of the smell of a dry sauna with the wood and sweat. Hot, intense, acidic. It's all peel, no fruit. As I observed in a long ago review of one of their other beers, ""The insistent hot and resiny taste with an unforgiving bitterness seems like the Surly signature.""

I’ve heard good things about Transient bu haven’t has them until now. Let’s pop thid guy open see what it’s all about Pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of dense dark tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing The maple honestly isn’t even the first thing that jumps out at me in the nose, opting for a thinner maple profile to support the other adjuncts. I’m picming up on aromas of dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, milk chocolate, maple sap, burnt caramel, molasses, charred oak, and light vanilla It’s also not extremely maple in taste, but it is unfortunately a bit sweeter than the nose led me to believe. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting burnt caramel, dark roast coffee, black cherry, dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, toasted oak, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, black cherry, raisin, vanilla, toasted oak, and sweet bourbon A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer.

The neck tops a bone white hue with a darkened downturn, of a penny toned rim. Thus, not much room for retention, which is limiting on lace entanglements. A collar that continues to lessen with a sensibility on heat, for slightly etching the windowpanes S: A barrel awareness to stronghold the roasted grains with a bourbon presence. The start is a molasses coating on dark fruit skins, as an espresso roast loiters to the maple backs, of a sickly shrewd growth. Namely, a syrupy tumor upon the timed warmness, as malt creams the humid agilities. There are light recordings of Cherry Cordials at the midriffs, while maple further purifies a combating to an adjoining development in the bourbon spaces. Meanwhile, a balanced hop weight to avoid a suffocating middle, which provides a light peppery woodiness near rearward resin. Subsequently, a hindmost movement from soft to mild – vanilla oak – tannins that signify a leathery convoy, besides the smoked-dry turfs T: The exertion has a cask dynamism of arrogance, as malt initially struggles to materialize off of burnt coffee. Howbeit, liquored hardihood stretches upon charred Raisinets, while conveying angles to figs & plums. Some positioning on early adoptions to tire track licorice with woodsy tannin partitions, which aid to reinforce those black treacle gears. In succession, a measure for the warming openness to adapt a caramel spread, for Scottish tablets, amidst the maple reinforcements on artisan S'mores. There is a small stake to reference trees of a deciduous nature, while dabbing at coniferous pine needles. This element further stretches across birch & paperbark maple, given a sharp (resinous) bite to kick-off the epilogs. To that end, a prevalence for maple to gridlock bourbon atop ruggedly pruned rawhide, while citing a slow-burning chimney fire M: Sharply cutting feel that’s savvy in foundation with a bitter earthiness, and one to quickly smoothen out to the minute. In doing so, the effort is careful to not middle a cloyingness, by maintaining a clean acuity to the riding sweetness. There is a range of warmth that’s distinctively strong, but not a concern to dictate a heated fiasco. In parallel, a touch of acerbic tannin throughout, which works to profit the additives attributes with a slight sting to the clean & dry cessations O: A fairly accessible presentation with a barrel presence to check the (semi-stick) extracts. A tactic that’s proficient in coordinating the rich malt layers to the woodsy hop effects, while bourbon perimeters all of their showpieces Jun 28, 2022 Report",4.25

Hint of graham cracker and kiss of boozy barrel. The barrel was a bit more subtle than I anticipated however. Quite sweet overall, though appropriately so given the style. The flavor profile was nearly as impressive as the aroma and boozier. Again, marshmallow and vanilla came through super strong. Nice caramel and roasted malt base up front. Boozy bourbon notes appeared from the get go and intensified as the beer moved along the palate. Good dose of milk chocolate in the center. The beer was definitely sweet but not excessively so. More boozy bourbon barrel character on the back end and the finish. A pleasant alcohol warmth lingered after the swallow. Excellent rich, full bodied mouthfeel. Perhaps a touch thinner than I anticipated however. Oily and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, mellow effervescence that worked nicely for the style. Bourbon Barrel-Aged Rocky Road literally smelled like liquefied, booze-soaked s’mores, and it tasted pretty similar as well. Angry Chair Brewing are known for producing some of the best pastry stouts in the world, and this one did not disappoint. Aug 09, 2024 Report",4.74
Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by jrc1093 from Connecticut 4 /5 rDev -13% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4 2022 vintage; consumed on 1/20/2024 Pours a viscous, midnight-black body capped with just shy of a finger of dark khaki-hued foam; decent head retention leaves a slight layer of cap, lasting, frothy collar, and no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity. Aromas of gooey marshmallow waft into fruity rye spice as a walnut underscore embraces bourbon vanillins against a milk chocolate build and barrel char lingering. Taste brings cocoa resounding upfront, with bourbon vanilla interludes meeting a peak of chocolate-covered walnuts through the mid-palate while barrel char and darker cocoa residuals mark the back end of the profile. Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a lower froth of carbonation, yielding a thick, malted slickness over the mid-palate as a prickly warmth and wispy char cuts through a modest yet overarching stickiness into the back end. Minimal barrel yet true-to-form, the Rocky Road inspiration comes through in spades; an honest mock dessert à la sweet stout in typical Angry Chair fashion: comfortingly one-dimensional.

Shared with schen9303. Pours pitch black and dense. No head, no lace. Thick, oily, sticky legs. Nose is a boozy Rocky Road ice cream. Notes of fudge, chocolate, vanilla, and sweet cream. Some hazelnut and brown sugar as well. Pretty incredible how much it smells like the dessert. Beer opens chocolate, vanilla, and sweet cream. Hazelnut shell and ash. All the flavors are there but somehow this isn't too sweet. A touch of roasted malt and cocoa powder towards the end just to add a slight bitterness. Barrel throughout that becomes more prominent as this one warms. This is delicious! Body is medium with low carbonation. Smooth and somehow soft on the palate. Sticky and boozy going down with a long, lingering aftertaste. I'm usually a fan of heavier bodies but somehow this works perfectly. I'm a couple of years behind the hype here but these Angry Chair adjunct stouts have been incredible. The nose and flavors are perfect. Feb 19, 2023 Report",4.56

Pours a dark black body, slight cola brown hue, one finger white head, short retention and a fair bit of lacing. Smell is massive chocolate and marshmallow, with a fair bit of nuttiness. Lots of chocolate fudge. It literally smells like the ice cream flavour would. A mild amount of whiskey as well, but the nose is primarily chocolate fudge, in the most authentic way possible. Flavour is Rocky Road ice cream with a shot of bourbon poured over it. That's pretty much all there is to it- the vanilla/marshmallow adds a nice counter sweetness to the chocolate fudge, cocoa and the nuttiness adds a nice dimension on top. Mouthfeel is medium fuller bodied, creamy with appropriate carbonation, slightly thin than expected. Overall, a very nice and big pastry stout that is essentially like drinking liquid ice cream.

Smell: smells like a freakin hot fudge sundae! It so sweet with huge notes of vanilla and chocolate intermingled together. Then there's the marshmallows and just faint notes of toasted walnuts. Did not pick up much of the bourbon though. But that's okay, I'm just blown away by the aromas of all the adjuncts. Taste: again, mind blown. It's hot fudge sundae in a glass. Its really hard to get more specific than that. So chocolatey and sweet with marshmallows, vanilla ice cream, and walnuts. At room temperature the bourbon became more noticeable as well as the walnuts. Not much alcohol warmth until the very finish. Some beers in the market are so sickly sweet however this beer makes the exception; while its sweet, its unique flavors are balanced and easy to appreciate. Mouthfeel: thick and full-bodied. Smooth, creamy, not so harsh. Overall: a one of a kind beer. Never expected this to smell and taste like a hot fudge sundae. The flavors really stand up to its name of the beer!

The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time and leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – the aroma is big of a resinous pine and grapefruit hop mixed with an almost vanilla-orange creamsicle like smell.  Other sweet aromas of tropical fruits are in the nose as well, with tangerine, mango, and papaya.  Light notes of a floral nature and a bit of breadiness are there as well, producing a sweet and big smell overall. Taste – The taste starts out with a bready and doughy malt flavor mixed with a rather strong presence of tangerine and mango.  At the same time there is a decent hit of grapefruit and pine as the nose would have suggested, with the grapefruit really amping up as the taste advances.  At the same time some of the tangerine/orange and vanilla add a creamsicle dimension to the brew, with other sweet flavors of peach and apricot bringing even more fruit to the table.  The hop increases more toward the end, and with notes of white pepper, melon, wood, and booze, one is left with a very rich and sweet, smooth hopped taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body is quite thick and creamy with a moderate carbonation level.  The thick feel is great for the high abv and sweeter flavors, making this a nice slow sipper. Overall – A rather big and robust hazy IPA with lots of flavor and a good hit of alcohol. Another rather enjoyable brew by FFF. Nov 21, 2024 Report",4.26

Taste is bam alpha resins tingling the taste buds, nice sticky pine resin with underlying over ripe citrus notes all riding on a sweet malty caramel base that is big enough to hold them all. Finish is dunk resin, light herbal notes mingled with the bitterness, almost chewy with a alcohol bite from the 10.5% letting you know to take this beer seriously.

Pours a beautiful golden shade, perfectly clear with tons of bubbles and a large fluffy head that slowly disappears Insane aroma of pine, melon, just extreme levels of hops with a massive malt backbone to stand up to it. Quintessential west coast bite and snappiness. Taste is extremely dry, this is really only for someone who enjoys the tongue-melting high-powered IPA flavors that a lot of modern beers are moving away from. It's less of a dank or juicy flavor but an overwhelming amount of hops. You can definitely taste the 10.5% and it's not shy about reminding you that it's an experience. In spite of all of this, it's insanely refreshing. I hate to say it, but my palate would be very happy using this as a session beer. Unfortunately, my liver wouldn't make it past the second, but the beautiful combination of strong malt to help balance out outrageously aggressive hops means that while it comes off as very heavy, it's horribly easy to drink. Mouthfeel is perfect. My first 4pk was flat and really grossly boozy, but the beer itself is lightly carbonated. Doesn't coat the mouth or dry you out whatsoever. Additionally, since it's so dry, there's no residual sugar and it's quite refreshing like an IPA should be. Overall, 3 Floyds had no reason to help me out and replaced my beer after a weird mishap rendered my original 4pk completely disgusting. I have no idea what happened but they got back to me and replaced it within a day. The actual product is outrageously delicious and lives up to all the hype I had after seeing the can art and that it was a collab with a metal band. You could probably drink 3 of these in an hour, and then have a really bad morning. It's really that good. Nov 15, 2023 Report",4.71

Everett,"Reviewed by JohnniEMc from Pennsylvania 4.79 /5 rDev +6.7% look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75 A practically filled clear pint glass arrived after this was drawn from a tap. It's richly black coffee brown, made even more beautiful by the quarter-inch tight tan head on top. There's a hearty roasted malt aroma to accompany the sight, bringing notes of dark chocolate and espresso. Fully bodied, without being sticky, nor viscous, this has a nearly perfect delivery. To taste, the roasted barley malt is to the point of pleasant bitterness. Along with the dark chocolate and espresso flavor references, there's even some black licorice during the delightful finish. It's so fully flavored, there's no evidence of the alcohol. Stratified glass lacing appears, as the liquid is quickly removed from the glass, completing the visual. This has to be amongst the best of its kind, although some who like a milder stout may not get passed the roasted bite and disagree. Nov 06, 2024 Report",4.79

This is awesome to finally get my hands on a long time want of mine, not to mention I get the pleasure of trying this just 3 days after canning. Let’s crack it open and find out what all the hype is about Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing Oh yeah, the nose displays such a wonderful balance between roast and sweetness, I love it. I’m picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, brown sugar, earthy hops, raisin, dark toast, light toffee, vanilla, and black pepper It really upholds the aroma in taste, though maybe a tad less sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting drip coffee, dark bread, brown sugar, honey, milk chocolate, raisin, vanilla, light caramel, and earthy hops. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, molasses, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, raisin, dark toast, vanilla, toffee, and earthy hops A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and roasty This is everything I was hoping it would be. Wonderfully balanced and smooth, yet drinks well under its abv.

Poured the expected dense, nearly solid, black color with about an inch of tan head head that had decent retention and lacing. The aroma had a solid, but not overpowering, amount of roast at the front of the nose, backed with solid grains, and just a bit of floral hops. Similar on the tongue, a good blend of grain, roast, and soft, slightly grassy, hops. The body was also about typical for the style, perhaps a touch fuller than usual, smooth, and had a dry, roasty finish that lingered. Drinkability was very good, a nice sipper, and an easy quaffer at the same time. Overall, a very nicely done brew. A must-try if you get the chance. Apr 13, 2022 Report",3.63

Aroma features an extensive malt char deftly interwoven with lager yeast and toasty brown bread as tinges of beechwood smoke and bakers chocolate over the middle engage minerality into the back end and hints of coffee on the close. Taste shows touches of leathery char and burnt coffee upfront, with added nuances of bakers chocolate against a rounded lager yeast and a touch of minerality over the mid-palate; malt roast grazes the back end, while brown bread crusts and nutty coffee grounds offer a subtle inflection on the finish. Mouthfeel brings a medium body with a medium-full carbonation, a purely silky texture seeing a sinewy backbone weaving grit and char to pseudo-creamy sensations throughout the mid-palate toward a firm, drying, and persistently roasty back end to nimble harmony on the finish. Lagery roast finds waves of smoke and silky chocolate undertones to fuse with an obsessive Hill Farmstead precision of texture, bringing the modesty of an American Porter to climax with detailed expression on an otherwise restrained medium.

Perfectly balanced with a nutty malt backbone that stops just short of drifting into stout territory. Feel: perfect body; thick but not chewy or overly sugary.  Carbonation was on point and makes this eminently drinkable. Overall: hands down one of the best--if not the best--porters I've had in a while.

Hill Farmstead is on my shortlist for must-visit breweries. They have several beers I want to consume. They have a best-by date to drink: furthermore, I am sure it is okay; it is only a couple weeks past. The beer was carefully maintained to preserve its integrity of the beer. I poured into a Willi Belcher glass; the temperature was 46 degrees. A frothy and creamy three-fingered dark tan head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 24, dark oily brown. The appearance of the beer is beautiful. Oh wow, the malty profile is vibrant and aromatic.  I smell dark roasted malts, chocolate, medium roasted coffee, a hint of floral, leather, intense earthiness, and subtle char note. Coffee and chocolate smack your tastes buds in the sweet spot. Dark roasty malts, toast bread, a touch of floral, a dab of Maillard, a tinge of char, tobacco, leather, earthiness, and a slight herbal note is what I taste next. The beer is a parade of flavors doing a technical difficult choreograph dance with precision on your palate. The mouthfeel is a little bit bitter, with some creaminess followed by a skosh of dryness. The body is medium, medium carbonation, and has a long and delightful finish. One of the best porter I have ever consumed. It has all the great qualities of stout but in the porter style. I love the robust flavors and creaminess with the bitterness. Oct 10, 2021 Report",4.77

Received in early June 2021 in Ninja box from @Roy_Hobbs.  16 oz can stored at home at 42 degrees.  Reviewed 1/7/21.  Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Bottom rim stamped “CANNED 05/18/21 DRINK BY 09/18/21”.  Served at 53.0 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Final temperature 60.6 degrees. Appearance – 4.5. First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear. Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. When rear-lite, opaque but translucent amber brown at the edges. Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), wheat, high density initially but quickly opening, average retention, diminishing to leave a 0.7 to 1.0 cm lacy crown and a thin complete cap.  An archipelago of foam islands resembling coral atolls remains on the sides of the glass above the crown.  Second pour produces a dense 0.7 cm head. Lacing – Fair.  Wide band of tiny bubbles, separating into two bands, with short, blunt, stalactites.  See also above. Aroma – 4.25 – Begins with roasted malt and cocoa, no hops, no yeast, no coffee. Flavor – 4.25 – Begins slightly sweet with roasted malt and cocoa and a hint of coffee, no hops, no yeast.  No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma.  Slight gastric warming does occur.  No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.  Ends slightly bitter. Palate – 4 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4.25 Very velvety mouthfeel.  The first few swallows went from slightly sweet to very bitter with alarming swiftness, but then it seemed to smooth out, just ending slightly bitter in counterpoint to the initial sweetness.  Predominant taste and odor are roasted malt and cocoa, with just a hint of a smoky coffee on the tongue.  In total, particularly good porter. Jul 01, 2021 Report",4.24

Canned on 5/18/2021.  Poured at 59° into a Willi Becher pint glass.  It pours nearly black with very dark cola hues at the bottom of the glass when held to the light, with a large, fluffy, medium khaki-colored had and thick creamy lacing.  It's a beautiful pour.  Its fragrant nose features dark chocolate, cigar smoke, burnt coffee grounds and charred nuts.  Wow, the taste is amazing!  The initial chocolate malt sweetness is juxtaposed to acidic coffee (like it's from a Jersey diner), and bitter, earthy, nutty char.  There is also strong tobacco.  The blend and balance of flavors are exquisite.  The mouth feel is rich and creamy - almost stout-like - with mild carbonation, and the 7% ABV seems perfect. Everett is highly drinkable but with excellent substance.  This Porter is big and flavorful enough to pair with a fine meal of roasted red meat but you could easily drink a couple of pours casually.  Everett's 100 Score is well-deserved.  It's as good an American Porter as you'll have the great pleasure of drinking. May 30, 2021 Report",4.52

Just all the great things about fall, roasted in a perfect blend. Taste- The best blend of coffee-chocolate-nut roast I have ever experienced in any dining experience. Simply unbelievable, everything is roasted perfectly in their own right--no burn chocolate or coffee taste, nothing is lost or overpowers. Absurd. Feel- Stouty without being thick or cumbersome.

Bittersweet chocolate, city dark roast coffee grounds, and charcoal suggests a grittiness that swirls within a medium-full body that never cloys nor removes focus from the flavor. Tough to tell where roast ends and hops begin, both giving tremendous depth of flavor. I am most impressed with the light smoke/kindling character that comes through subtly on the finish, almost just an olfactory sensation. It really takes the roast flavor and overall experience over the top. In the style, I've had nothing that comes close Feb 28, 2020 Report",4.75

This has a 6/19 canning date, so I was ready for it to be on the fade (and maybe it is, though I can’t imagine it much brighter) but instead it is one of the jumpingest citrus-and-tropical bombs I can remember. It instantly wins my personal award for Best Handling of Galaxy, Most Realistic Orange Flavor, and Most Fun in a NEIPA. The fruit pushes towards orange Jujubees or (as someone else said) creamsicle, but stops short of being sickly. More like the fresh squeezed character that Tree House is supposedly famous for than Tree House actually is (in my experience.) There’s no burn, cloy, murk, pulp, sweat or vegetable - deftly sidesteps all the usual NEIPA errors. If I have to find fault, it’s that there’s one blast of bouncy yum, rather than a nuanced taste experience - it doesn’t have the same depth as OH, and I don’t think it’s trying to. But when it’s this tasty + drinkable, who cares? Can’t believe it took me this long to discover this. Possibly the best NEIPA flagship. Nov 04, 2024 Report",4.36

Medium bodied with moderate creaminess. I picked this up, knowing it was a New England style IPA, because it is listed as Trillium's flagship American IPA. Sadly, it is in the category of mild bitterness NE style, which are not to taste. The aroma was OK, but the taste seemed subdued and muddled, with some citrus and pine, but otherwise unidentifiable juice notes that remind me of fruit juice that has set out for a while. I keep trying this style, particularly well received ones and every once in a while I find a nicely bitter one with some bright defined flavors; this was not one of them. It's satisfactory and I do appreciate the sometimes intense hop notes in these, but they seem vague to me. I see I did like Bake and Break from these guys, so I'll watch for another promising one.

It's so green Dec 4th 2023. Turbid with a bit of a hinting shiny body, but fast carbonated with murky yellowish tinge.  Classic bright solid white cap, four to three fingers thick and rich and not budging on the glass at all. Very interesting hop aroma.  Spicy and thick, hints slightly dank and pungent with mushy pineapple and strangely as well with what seems like pickle brine.  Large amounts of earth and soily sweetness that hits like a smokey wallop. Delicious palate.  Chewy tasting, with a flavor that feels like mint chewing gum and tropical hop richness.  Minty warm, with pungent aromas on the palate hinting pineapple and vanilla, giving a touch of pina colada like quality.  Minty and nice soft bitterness that melds wonderfully on the finish.  Reminds me somewhat of ice cream in flavor with the texture. Quite a fascinating IPA.  Kind of wish the fruit character was a little more pronounced and dominant, but there is little to complain about here. Jan 11, 2024 Report",4.46

The head has an amazing level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is heavy of a tropical fruit smell with tons of papaya and mango, as well as a good showing of tangerine and pineapple.  At the same time there is a thick bready and doughy smell as well as notes of apricot and nectarine. Hop aromas of grapefruit and herb are rather intense and with some raw hop smells and a bit of yeast, a very inviting and intense aroma is produced overall. Taste – The taste starts out with a sweeter and more malty start with a big showing of the tropical fruit flavors (tangerine, orange, pineapple, and mango) that were in the nose.  There is also a lightly toasted and very bready malt flavor that has hints of a smooth oat and grain.  There is a strong presence of hop from the start as well, with a massive grapefruit pulp and rind flavor paired with floral notes and a bit of herb.  The floral and the herb, get more intense as the taste advances, getting up to the strength of the grapefruit hop.  All the while the sweetness fades a tad, all while a bit of must and hay comes to the tongue.  At the very end, a raw green hop taste joins in, and with the other flavor transitions, one is left with a juicy and fresh hopped taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is very thick and chewy with a moderate level of carbonation.  Fantastic for the flavors and the style, making for an indulgent, slow sipper. Overall - Big, rich, and fresh.  A very well-crafted brew and one to seek out if you have the opportunity. Dec 28, 2023 Report",

The Greenest Green,"Reviewed by BEERchitect from Kentucky 4.49 /5 rDev -1.1% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Growing greener and greener than ever, Tree House brewers take the decade of hop learning and applies it to an imperial New England-styled IPA that takes Green where Green has never gone before. Not quite ""compost-green"" in color, The Greenest Green's viscous haze ebbs and flows into the glass taking the appearance of tarnish yellow grapefruit and orange juices- perhaps with extra pulp. As its seductively creamy head builds, its juicy, tantalizing and irresistible fruit aromas spring forth with the vibrancy of exotic citrus and tropical fruit punch- but however with its own curious herbaceous bouquet. Creamy, poundcake-like and full with cereal, its seemingly fructose taste offers a fruity tanginess that evokes teeth-churning behavior in the very first sip. And as the taste blossoms across the middle palate, its secrets reveal, layer by layer. Fruity sweetness begins to drift while the tropical fruits rise to the forefront- first the pineapple, mango, apricot and passionfruit. With full hoppy saturation mounting on the tastebuds, the acidity of ripe tangerine, lemon, lime and gooseberry turn to a dry sherbet flavor for complexity and charm. Not to be outdone, its smooth bitterness is balanced and sharply acidic with an undertow of chive, fresh grass clippings, shallot and cannabis. Working both the creamy and dry segments in mouthfeel, the beer is juicier than ever while trending flavorful, fruity and piquantly resinous. Finishing with a sappy pine flavor, the beer's overwhelming hop complexity completely seduces the palate and easily makes the palate forget about the bitter and caramelized taste of imperial American IPA gone by.

Green is a perennial favorite from Tree House, and this is the stickiest and most greentastic version of that I’ve had yet. It’s just super saturated and thick with hop character, without tasting syrupy. There’s loads of the expected pineapple and mango here, with tons of orange and tangerine citrus, and very little bitterness. It’s just got that extra little push beyond Green or Very Green – it’s not a full on uppercut, but it’s definitely a hard shove. This is thick and creamy, with a wonderful drinkability, and no hint at all of the 8.8% ABV. It’s honestly old hat at this point, this is wonderful, of course it is.

Little lacing. Nose is pineapple and bitter orange, resiny oils, little detectable malt presence. The flavor is a wee, little burst of the rinds of those fruits followed by a big (but shortlived) wave of those same fruits… but this time just their bitter, oily, perfumey aromatics. This then dissipates into a lingering, bitter hop buzz and not much else. The mouthfeel is less of that classic round, fluffy juiciness and more total hop saturation. That said, it is quite pleasant and doesn't venture into sappy or hop burny or astringent territory. As it warms, some of the hoppy-yeasty estery sweetness as well as a scoche of malt character come out, but even then it is a one-two-three punch (that's a thing, right?) of the two main facets of the hops: Sweetbitter-bittersweet-bitter in quick succession.  Regardless of any way the the beer could be better, this back and forth shift with ever sip is extremely enjoyable and impressive to have pulled off from a brewing perspective. In looking through my reviews of a few of its predecessors, I can see how it is a clear extension of them. The main thing I notice is that in previous amped-up versions, the fruity sweetness held its own and offered a foil to the bitter resinous palate shellac potential contained within the hop profile. In this particular beer, though, the bitter oiliness has overtaken the rest and I have to really seek out the non-bitter aspects of it. They say on the can that this is a result of their series to see how far they could push the envelope before it was too much. Yeah, I could see that. Interesting to have this bitter of a Treehouse beer. 4.25...4.5...4.5...4.5...4.5 Aug 13, 2023 Report",4.49

Let’s dive right in Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of frothy dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing There’s a delicate balance in the nose here that is just wonderful. I’m picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee, sweet vanilla, black cherry, cocoa powder, raisin, brown sugar, dark bread, and a touch of leather While not quite as masterfully balanced in taste, this is still damn good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, brown sugar, caramel, raisin, vanilla creme, dark bread, and light toffee. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, vanilla creme, brown sugar, raisin, burnt caramel, and dark bread A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky beer.

La Fosse,"Reviewed by BEERchitect from Kentucky 4.49 /5 rDev -0.4% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Taking inspiration from famous Brussel's apricot sour ale, Side Project is brewing more like pros when brewing and aging their own unique spin on the fruited gueuze style. La Fosse brings a golden tinge to an otherwise bubbly champagne pour. But the beer strikes the nose with force as the overwhelming sour scent tightens the jaws and wets the whistle with fruit, funk and fauna. A scantly sweet introduction is of light wafer, sourdough and a brief hint of taffy. But anything seeming sweet is short and succinct on the middle palate. The session quickly favors the stone fruit with a light orange, mango and peach character. Shying away from fruit rollup, the beer quickly trends vinous and winey with sharp chardonnay, bubbly dryness and a piquant spice. Its bracing acidity washes any thirst from the palate as the late taste brings an earthen tone of balsa, burlap and extended wood-age white wine. Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the ale is a cleaner taste compared to more Brussels brewed versions, but this brighter, cleaner and fruitier version is just as good. May 02, 2023 Report",4.49

Cool bottle, neat cap. Consumed on 04/07/23, review from notes. A&S: The beer's appearance is bright orange at first and moves to a muddy orange as the remaining beer and sediment are poured in. The head is fizzy and big, there is some lacing. The aroma is powerful! Chalky yeast, tart peaches, and apricots. T&M: The taste is acidic, fruity, tart, and lemony. Very clean. Cereal finish. Tartness is cleared out when the sediment is poured in and the funk comes through more than before. The high carbonation is champagne-like at first, then comes in a little more creamy later on. Overall: It is one of the better beers I have ever had. Perfect for a warm summer day. Apr 16, 2023 Report",4.51

Pours a golden-copper with notable floaties and particles suspended in the beer. Head is a finger of white foam. Aroma is lemongrass, herbal, stone, and apricot. Apricot isn't forward, molding into the surroundings for a subtle twist of sweetness. Nose has a light tanginess to it, but it's faint. Flavor profile is apricot forward, which lays on top of herbal, lemongrass, and stone. Finish is notably tangy and funky, much more so than the nose.

Mocha Wednesday,"Reviewed by BubbleBobble from New York 4.37 /5 rDev -2.7% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5 2021 vintage. Pours a dark brown with lots of flecks of ruby red as the light hits it; pours rather thin with a fizzy cola head that disappears quickly. Bits of carb hitting the surface. No lacing/retention. Nose is roasted coffee beans, molasses, black licorice, loose change, baking chocolate. Very little barrel character, at least initially. Kind of mind-blowing these days to have a chocolate and coffee stout that doesn't lay it on thick with raw adjunct aromas; while the coffee and chocolate are certainly there, they feel like parts of a whole that developed together, rather than some gunk that's thrown in and overpowers the product. Taste follows a similar vein - big coffee roasted coffee bean notes throughout the palate. Through its very long finish, dark chocolate and dark fruit, vanilla, smoky wood, salty black licorice, and finally, traces of warming, spicy bourbon emerge. As on the smell, a really impressive use of the adjuncts here - not at all overpowering, but still present throughout. Mouthfeel is the only real knock for me. The feel is surprisingly thin, and I think a little more body would be nice (and even expected?) given the ABV. Really worth seeking out. Apr 18, 2023 Report",4.37

I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, coffee, vanilla, cacao nibs and roasted malt.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some oak and fudge flavors noticeable too.  Good amount of barrel character in both the taste and aroma.  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, rich and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Head retention is okay. Aroma is mocha, toffee, caramel, coffee and soothing bourbon with a kiss of char. Roasty and toasty malts form a resoundingly steady base. Flavor profile is mocha, toffee, caramel and then a searing slice of bourbon and heat. After the heat subsides, the focus goes back to lightly sugary with a heavy malt base. Malts come by way of roasty and toasty. Sweetness comes from more mocha and chocolate than try to outweigh the lingering bourbon heat. Mouth feel is thick and full with a velvety, heavy creamery texture. Overall, hot and booze with some kisses and glimpses of sweet. Balance may be a strong word here, as it veers pretty far on both sides of the heat vs. sweet spectrum, but it does all net out within each dynamic sip.

Dark pour, subtle crimson hue just like the others. Some thin, frothy head bubbles up on the pour, but it’s got a good look and the head dissipates quickly with no lace left behind. Loads of coffee on the nose with subtle but not unpleasant notes of green pepper. Many more experienced beer drinkers know green pepper to be an oxidation side effect in stouts that have coffee in them. Not abnormal, but not typically preferred. Those subtle hints of oxidation don’t take away from anything, though, with a predominance of espresso, baker’s chocolate, charred oak barrel, and bourbon aromas. Rich notes of chocolate and coffee hit first, with less green pepper than on the nose. Overall, for a beer that is recommended to be consumed fresh has held up really well. Some charred oak character emerges as the beer warms and helps to compliment that bourbon flavor. Really nice balance between the base beer, the barrel, and the adjuncts. Nice medium weight to the beer, with low carbonation and a warm, boozy finish. Mildly viscous and not overly syrupy. Dec 30, 2018 Report",4.35

The body of the beer is full, medium carbonation, and a full linger finish. This beer surprises me, the massive flavors with a delicate touch in a strong beer.

Anyways, I'm pouring from a 750 ml. 2016 bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out just like the others, way lighter than beers similar in the style. Brown in color with highlights all the way through. The smell is warming bourbon with a mocha backdrop. Raisins and plums evident as well. The taste comes in with that same burning sensation and provides dark fruit notes. A very nice chocolately finish. There is some coffee and mocha presence in there, but for the main part it's slight and if not advertised, I think most would just think of a bourbon barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy and great for the style. Overall, this has probably been my favorite of these so far. But still nothing blowing me out of the water. I guess I'll just keep swimming.

Vaguely remember this coming out so was kind of surprised to see it now. I’m a huge fan of AleSmith stouts, specifically Speedway Stout and the variants. I won’t get into all the variants, but gave the regular Speedway Stout a 4.30 on Dec. 25, 2012; Vietnamese Speedway Stout a 4.53 on April 6, 2016 and Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Speedway Stout a 4.72 on Dec. 31, 2016. Seems like a nice progression to this. Back of the bottle read “AleSmith is proud to release this long-awaited and intensely aromatic Russian Imperial Stout with Vietnamese coffee. We traditionally brew Vietnamese coffee, known as cà phê sữa đá, with a phin-style filter that gently percolates water through ground coffee. The result is a chocolaty and bold tasting coffee that perfectly complements the notes of oak, vanilla, and spice in this massive rye whiskey barrel-aged stout.” Following a slow-moving gusher that took some work to get under control, poured a pittch-black color with 1-to-2 fingers of khaki tan fizzy head, which dissipated quickly. Calm setting underneath the head with just a few noticeable bubbles. Average foggy lacing. Decent retention. (Sight - 3.50) Smelled super boozy, a bit surprising after four years. Big oak, spicy rye, leather, caramel, black coffee, vanilla, chocolate syrup, molasses and cacao. Got a little better as it warmed. Even better out of the bottle with the addition of toffee and more vanilla. (Smell - 4.50) Wow. The taste was so much better than smell. Where the nose was boozy and unrefined, the taste was smooth and mellow. Got milk chocolate, smooth black coffee, oak, rye spice, cacao, leather, caramel, chocolate syrup, vanilla, toffee, sticky molasses and dark fruit. Tasted about 8-to-9 pct. ABV, not 13.0 pct. (Taste - 4.50) Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Soft-to-flat carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 5.00) Just an awesome beer.

The finish starts to bring out a peppery sense of rye whiskey, adding a spiced note, as well as offering more wood.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Rye Whiskey Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by Harrison8 from Missouri 4.71 /5 rDev +3.1% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75 Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam rising out of the glass after a moderate pour. Head formation is great, especially considering the age of the bottle (2017? can't find a date), with head retention being good. Aroma is thick stout qualities of roasty, toasty, caramely, bready malts. Malts form the foundation, in which a lightly sugary nose is built, with bits and pieces of toffee, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, milk chocolate and coffee coming through. The latter adds just a touch of bitterness, just enough to counteract the lightly sugary notes before (while a lengthy list of sugary descriptors, they don't come off as cloying or as heavy sweet). Rye whiskey adds just a hint of smoothness at the finish, rounding out the sweet-leaning aroma with dry spice. Flavor profile is even more in-depth, with a similar list of malts forming the base - roasty, toasty, nutty, and caramely. As the malts pass, brown sugar, chocolate (mildly sweet milk and bitter baker's chocolate), molasses, and toffee come sweeping onto the palate. Together, they form a lightly-sweet leaning flavor profile. Sweetness is counterbalanced by coffee, which is mild, lightly fleshy, and surprisingly fruity, and further washed away by a dry heat courtesy of the rye whiskey. Barrel adds just a kiss of char and smoke, but it's gone in an instant - akin to an ember spark from a campfire. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, creamy texture that keeps each sip flowing smoothly. Overall, lots of depth, flavor and still plenty of nuance without being just a cannon blast of flavor. Coffee is delicate, but present. I wouldn't consider it the focal point of the beer, but instead an integral cog in making this machine work. Together, it amasses to a well made stout, complimented by the use of barrel. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle. Beer review #2000.

Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy tan head with solid retention, that reduces to a this cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, spicy rye whiskey, toasted oak, fudge, roasted nuts, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, molasses, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/oaky earthiness. Light increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/black/roast/bready malts, coffee, rye whiskey barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with big strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, spicy rye whiskey, toasted oak, fudge, roasted nuts, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, molasses, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, roast, char bitterness; and rye whiskey/oak tannin spiciness on the finish.

Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, coffee, rye whiskey barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a great roast/hop bitter/sweet, and rye whiskey/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/roast bitterness, and whiskey/oak spiciness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mild increasing warmth of 13%, with minimal lingering barrel booze after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged Russian imperial coffee stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, coffee, rye whiskey barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV, with the mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Fantastic soft feel for the style/ABV; not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy/tannic on barrels. Perfectly balanced super rich malts, fruity/nutty coffee complexity, and rye whiskey barrel presence/integration; with mild earthy hops and fruity English yeast. Not overly sweet/heavy from lingering dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazing top tier quality style example as expected. Aged wonderfully. Jul 03, 2019 Report",4.35
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Rye Whiskey Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by Amguerra305 from Florida 4.91 /5 rDev +7.4% look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75 I remember regular ba Vietnamese speedway was really good and I did not think the barrel could improve improve what was an already stellar beer; but boy was I wrong. Just the slightest amounts of dispersed pin size bubbles sitting atop the Black, almost oily, liquid.  The smell is divine.  Deep chocolate coffee sweet barrel with strong vanilla and spicy rye notes. I feel it’s what all barrel aged stouts are striving; strong prominent barrel with an underlying base that stands up to it. Taste is kind of sweet with a strong alcohol boozy back end that gives it an almost brandy like finish.  A little coffee creaminess in the middle as well. One of the very few knocks on this beer is that it is a tad too carbonated. You can tell that the beer is kind of silky which would only increase the creaminess of its taste but the bubbles prevent a full and utter mouth coat. Overall this is a noticeable improvement from the regular ba Vietnamese. Truly amazing beer; the best of the speedways I have had. Jan 16, 2018 Report",4.91

Mango, orange, peach, honey and caramel all backed by a dank background. The taste comes in with those dank, pronounced layers of citrus tangling through sweet layers of honey and caramel; slight bubblegum wants to come out but never does with much pronunciation, just as an accent. There are some floral notes, but not too pronounced. Fairly clean with little to no sharpness; slight bitterness but overall smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel.

Mild-moderate spicy bitterness, otherwise big but relatively balanced galaxy and caramel malt. This is pretty delicious, and the honeyed finish is really, really very nice.

Location: Rodgers, AR Style: Milk Stout A.B.V.: 10.2% Canned: 2018/2019 Date: 24 Nov 2024 I have another one of these in the cellar. I am have waited and waited to drink this beer, then I forgot.  I am using a pint glass and serving the beer at 46 degrees. The pour created a frothy one-fingered, light tan head with average retention. The somewhat quick dissipation left a foamy layer on top of the glass. The beer's color is inky black with dark brown hues, charting at SRM 34, and opaque. The appearance of the beer is average for this style. Nosing the glass, I smell dark chocolate, coffee, raisin, caramel, molasses, burnt sugar, light char, and earthy dirt. Smelling the beer again, I detect bourbon, oak, resin, light smoke, vanilla, and anise. The first sips of the beer, I taste vanilla, oak, resin, light smoke, char, anise, molasses, bittersweet chocolate, caramel, earthy dirt, and wood resin.  After a few swallows, I notice medium roasted coffee, toffee, bourbon, orange, light floral, and a malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is chewy and smooth, finishing creamy. The body is heavy and has low carbonation. I am enjoying these years, and not tasting any off-flavors. The beer is rich and full bodied milk stout with tons of flavor. This my first foray into the Ozark Beer Co. and I am looking forward to next beer from there. I am glad I was able to enjoy these beers. Nov 24, 2024 Report",4.16

After settling into the glass, it retains a lovely thin but noticeable dark brown ring of foam. Nose prominently features bourbon and oak, but not at the expense of the rich, roasty malt base. Notes of chocolate, red grape, prune, vanilla, honeycomb, molasses, coffee, and a touch of anise. Quite creamy on the palate, more than usual for a milk stout. The cream and vanilla notes blend harmoniously with the sweet bourbon profile, likely leading to that unusually strong character. Roastiness is present but not over the top. Impressively smooth, both in flavor and mouthfeel. Additional tasting notes of toast, light coffee, red grape, and semi-sweet chocolate. Supremely smooth BBA imperial (milk) stout, but it reminds me quite a bit of Dragon's Milk (but smoother). The creaminess borders on cloying, if not quite reaching that point; the bourbon is fairly simple and straightforward; the malt base could use a bit more oomph.

Received in a trade courtesy of @russpowell.  thank you! the beer pours a rich dark coffee brown color and no light passes through my glass when I hold it to a light source. A dense creamy head of 1 cm of tan foam rises up from the pour and quickly fades to a sturdy edge layer that sticks around throughout my sampling. There are also a few small islands spinning in the center of the glass.  Also get some scattered lacing when I swirl the glass or take a sip. Aroma is malt forward with milk chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar and a good whiff of bourbon note.  No warm or fusol alcohol more of the sweet side of bourbon.  Also no hop presence here at all on the nose. First sip reveals a very smooth textured medium bodied beer with fine soft and gentle carbonation.  The carb is very fine and gentle, which all makes for a velvety smooth physical experience. Flavor is what the nose advertises, with sweet chocolate, brown sugar and some vanilla, all giving way to bourbon notes and a little warming on the swallow.  Bourbon flavor lingers and also coats my lips.  I do get a little bit of a coffee note in the back of each swallow too.  Again, no hops to be found.

Poured into a snifter, this was an inky black, with no interest in becoming any lighter even when held up to light. Modest, half inch of khaki-mocha colored head. Sparse, spotty lacing. Bourbon up front in the nose, along with milk chocolate and coffee notes, pretty much in that order. More complex in the taste than in the nose. Still bourbon-y up front, and with a milk chocolatey sweetness, but there's also a bit of tobacco and dark fruit to the flavor.  It all melds together very, very well. Body is a little bit lighter than I expected, but not to a deal-breaking extent. Mouth feel is fairly creamy. This is a very nice BBA stout, one that hit the spot after dinner tonight. Earlier this week I found out for certain that my Mom does not have stomach cancer, as was feared for a time.

One thing to note - one of the cofounders worked for Goose Island, and brewed that brewery’s BCBS. He apparently learned a lot, because this beer takes the best of BCBS and cranks up the drinkability quotient.  This is the best beer I’ve had in 2022, and may be a Top 10 overall beer for me.

As the sweetness is quickly chased away by the roast and booze, the flavors of espresso sets in with baker's chocolate, roasted walnut and campfire to follow. Interrupted by the barrel, the flavors soon dominate with the strong oaken, toasted wood, weathered barrel influence with savory heat and bitter spices to close. Full bodied, full flavored and laying on the tongue with a heated glaze, the stout finishes both hot and sweet with a linger of savory heat in a long lasting afterglow. Jul 14, 2022 Report",4.02
BDCS,"Reviewed by brewerburgundy from West Virginia 4.11 /5 rDev -8.7% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25 12oz can, tulip, 2021 vintage. Oily, almost black, and nearly still. There is a thin head that’s quite dark brown. Hershey’s syrup, vanilla, rich bourbon, some soy sauce, and it’s vinous, with overripe red grape and fruit. The bourbon isn’t over the top, rather it’s woody, rich, and elegant. Ok, now that fat juicy grape bursts and mixes with melting chocolate bar, blackberry jam, walnut, and strong vanilla in the finish. The chocolate is a backdrop, weaving together Hershey’s syrup, dark chocolate Milky Way, and cocoa powder. The grape flavor is surprising in its strength. Very smooth, medium bodied, light and discrete carbonation. The flavors are intense and rich even though the body isn’t super rich. The bourbon is well done. Nov 06, 2021 Report",4.11

Little carbonation was visible. Smell - The nose was just like chocolate marshmallows. It was big and sweet, signifying a sugar bomb. Taste - The taste was not as sweet as the nose. It was chocolatey bourbon with a dry grape presence. There were notes of leather and coffee. As it warmed, I was made to think of hydrox cookies, and their dry chocolate notes.  This was definitely not an overt dessert stout. Mouthfeel - There was just a bit of carbonation and a slick body. Overall - A solid barrel aged stout that left me confused about the hype.

BDCS,"Reviewed by Prager62 from Colorado 4.78 /5 rDev +6.2% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75 Sent by the very generous @jvgoor3786 in a recent box of goodies. I poured from the 12oz. can into a 12oz. snulip glass. The pour is slick dark brown like used motor oil. It leaves a small layer of creamy tan foam in it's wake. Smells like bourbon, char, ripe dark fruit and molasses. The taste is very bourbon forward followed by dark roast/coffee, burnt brown sugar, fine tobacco. There's a slight sweetness that offsets the bourbon that is wonderful. The feel is oily smooth with noticeable alcohol warmth. It's been a spell since I've had a straight up barrel aged stout that wasn't overwhelmed by pastry ingredients. This reminds me of the early Bourbon County and Black Note years. It holds its own and brings a pleasant plethora of sensory delight without being overwhelming. This is the closest I've come to rating a 5 in a long time. World class and something I'd hoard if I had access to it! Mar 26, 2021 Report",4.78

Aroma opens with charry roast sporting a boozy cherry essence before a burly bourbon character takes over; burnt vanilla bean offers a slight bittersweetness over the middle, while the back end of the bouquet highlights increasingly defined notes of dark chocolate, Raisinets, and suggestions of cherry liqueur. Taste brings forth a vivid expression of sweet, bourbon-imbued malts with some savory umami aspects; melted marshmallow, chocolate soft serve ice cream, with toasty malt tones interspersed between; sweet pipe tobacco and baked cacao over the mid-palate feed into darker brownie crust intermingling with persistent roast on the back end for a lingering bourbon barrel presence and touches of raisin past the swallow. Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body, slick upfront and with minimal carbonation; steadily roasty through the mid-palate and mildly warming into the back end, a deft, boozy heat meshes with subtle grit and distantly chewy textures to close; a surprisingly tame delivery for a barrel-aged stout, though overwhelmingly satisfying given its plush characteristics. Quietly unique in its extraction of the sweeter malt profile, this beer brings the notion of a cream stout to life with an amplified yet consistently roasty sweetness in tune with a pillowy body and casual warmth; balanced to near-sessionability for a brew of its ABV.

No light passes even at the fringes of my Firestone Teku. A finger and a half of dense camel hued head with average retention but a unique fingerprint of wide and thin splotchy lacing. S: Soy sauce but lighter so than all soy brews I’ve encountered. This aroma is offset by burnt sugars, sweet molasses, dark roasted malts and the slightest vanilla and tobacco for a complex and mouthwatering brew. More vanilla as it warms. T: Follows the aroma mostly, but tends sweeter than I’d hoped for. The sugars mask the complexity found on the nose. Still quite good. Impossible that a beer rates so high on all parameters but only good on taste. F: Highest mouthfeel rating I’ve given to a beer lacking the weight and sticky viscosity of the best BCBS years. This one is thinner but also an amazing balance of syrup, sticky, oily, and creamy. It is lighter weight perfection. You must experience. O: I didn’t set out for a verbose review, but while so many BA Stouts fall short of my local Fremont’s, this one came outta nowhere with its complexity and simultaneous subtlety!

Bottle Number 239. 750 ml. 1 Pint, 9.4 fluid ounces. Alc. 10% by Volume. Aged in bourbon barrels. Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later. (Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle. I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.) Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile. Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it. Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things. It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight.

I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...). Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers. It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary. So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer. Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess). Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface. Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla. Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate. The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there). Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again! Feb 28, 2022 Report",4.45

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Reviewed by Sabtos from Ohio 4.3 /5 rDev -4.4% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Glossy black with a short mocha blanket settling to a soft persistent collar. This has an excellent balance between the wonderfully nutty, smoothly roasty stout body and the sticky, syrupy barrel character that dries out nicely on the swallow. The barrel provides Raisinettes, coconut drizzle, and bruleed toffee notes within the whiskey that's warming but measured. The body is actually moderately light and silky with a light crackly carbonation that comes to a semi-dry finish at first, but then leaves a light stickiness on the lips. Oct 18, 2019 Report",

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Reviewed by WickedBeer from Alabama 4.55 /5 rDev +1.1% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 2019 bottle. 12oz, 11% ABV. The pour is dark and viscous, poured cold so allowed room to warm, so not much of any rising head or visible carbonation. A thin beige ring surrounds the top of the beer in the glass. A huge chocolatey aroma reminds me of brownie batter, with a nice underlying complexity of molasses and dark fruit. There's a roasty malt character to this as well, but that initial chocolate dessert sweetness really wins the day on the nose. A fantast contrast in the flavor profile brings out a ton of barrel character, as well as a much stronger emergence of those dark fruits and molasses characteristics. The barrel brings out additional flavors of vanilla, oak, and bourbon, and roasty dark coffee begins to grab a good bit of influence as well as it warms further. In the finish its all bourbon, with a familiar boozy spice on the tail. Warming, smooth, viscous. As it slips down the back, there's a good level of residual mouth-coating, and does well to accompany a boozy burn down the hatch. Definitely would consider a full-bodied beer, and drinks like more of a 14+% BA stout, in all the best ways possible. Jun 26, 2019 Report",4.55

Never had it before, was on my want list for several years now. Poured a dark near black. Smells heavily barrel forward, and not cheap barrel at that. Tastes like the nose; barrel forward with the beer itself complimenting the notes of the barrel. Barrel lingers in the mouth for a bit then fades to the base beer. If you want a BA stout that isnt barrel dominant, this isn't for you. Interestingly, though, I usually fall in that camp and I absolutely love this beer and am hoarding all I can find of it.

I’m sure the coconut is past its prime but it’ll probably still be good. Let’s dig in Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing The nose is quite sweet, but there’s a surprising amount of coconut left and still rather balanced. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, molasses, brown sugar, raisin, raw coconut, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, burnt caramel, and light tobacco It doesn’t hold up quite as well in taste, but I can’t really say I have any complaints. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, molasses, vanilla, burnt caramel, brown sugar, black cherry, and light coconut. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, vanilla bean, toasted coconut, molasses, brown sugar, raisin, burnt caramel, and earthy bourbon A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer.

I am still determining how to pronounce Mackinac, but it is a maple fudge variant. I am using a tulip glass and serving the beer at 48 degrees. The pour created a frothy, creamy, one-fingered dark tan head with okay retention. The somewhat quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. I am charting the beer at SRM 38, which is inky black and opaque. The appearance is average for this style; I have seen longer-lasting heads on Imperial Stouts. Nosing the glass, I smell rich chocolate fudge, bourbon, coffee, malty sweetness, and bits of dankness. The fudge aromas resemble grandma's fudge she makes during the holidays. The fudge has a milk chocolate quality with a hint of dark, bittersweet baking chocolate and sugary. The coffee aroma is medium-roasted with a bit of wood and bitterness. The malt profile is roasty with char, subtle smoke, toasted cereal, and bready. The barrel aging added the need for complexity to round out the dominant aromas. The barrel added bourbon, oak, and caramel notes. Other scents I smell are toffee, molasses, figs, floral, a hint of dankness, tobacco, and vanilla. The beer has a delightful bouquet of aromas. I was concerned that this beer would be a sugar bomb, but I was pleasantly surprised. This beer is fantastic. The Fudge flavor is a bright, shining star, with a cadre of flavors filling the crucial roles needed to make this beer shine. The fudge is oozing chocolate flavors of milk chocolate and dark Belgian Chocolate. The barrel aging added a lovely depth with char notes, bourbon, and oak. The malt backbone is firm with flavors of roast and toasty cereal grains, bready, light smoke, and a skosh of Maillard. The other part of that cadre is the coffee. Mackinac Fudge has a fantastic coffee flavor: slightly bitter, medium-roasted, and earthy. The rest of the flavors are molasses, toffee, caramel, raisin, and a light floral finish. I did not mention the maple in the aromas or taste because I had difficulty discerning that flavor; the Chocolate was substantial. The mouthfeel is chewy and creamy, and the finish is smooth yet bitter. The body is heavy and has low carbonation. I enjoy this beer, and I am glad it is not a sugar bomb. However, I was disappointed that I could not smell or taste the maple; I think the chocolate-dominated flavor hid that—a fantastic sipper for the night. I will try another variant soon.

Pours impenetrable black, with a 0.5 finger, long lasting, sudsy, British khaki head, leaving light splotches of lacing. Initial aroma is seriously thick, and very heavy on booze, it smells a lot like a sweet alcohol. I pick up some maple, but I'm not sure I would have had I not known what it was. It's very sweet and sticky smelling, and there's maybe a hint of vanilla, though that could be the booziness. After agitating it remains the same, though slightly more alcohol. Initial taste before swallowing is powerful, it's got some bitterness to it but it's got sweetness behind it. There's a smoky char to it that I really enjoy. After swallowing I first get bitter cocoa powder. A strong char develops and lasts a good while, lasting into the finish where it mellows quite a bit and takes on a slightly metallic quality. All the whole sweetness lurks behind any foreground taste.

Near black body with a thin, semi-durable beige head.  A thin dark reddish-brown edge is visible with back lighting.  This smells quite sweet, I assume from the bourbon and maple syrup.  It has a lightly sweet taste with a laudably balanced mix of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee.  Not surprisingly, maple syrup notes are faint.  Relatively thick and very smooth body.  Well hidden ABV.

The aroma was strong, so strong even my Covid affected nose caught a wiff of the chocolate and bourbon. The taste was very well balanced for so much chocolate, and rich chocolate at that.  It was the star of the show but the supporting cast of coffee and dark fruits and bourbon were not lost but very present. The feel is darned near ideal for the genre, just a tiny bit less “chewy” or viscous than expected. Good beer, if they brew it again I would drink it fresh instead of cellaring it for 3 years.  But even then it is very good. Jul 09, 2023 Report",4.47

KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,"Reviewed by Prager62 from Colorado 4.18 /5 rDev -6.9% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 A bottle dated 08/09/22 refrigerated since purchasing in November of the same year. Poured in a KBS snifter for the review. A vigorous pour produces a dark brown liquid churning up a small finger of tan foam. It settles very quickly to a ring around the glass. The smell is dominated by what else? Mackinac fudge. A slight whiff of dark roast coffee. I'm not getting anything else. The taste is very much like the smell. Pure fudge followed by dark roast coffee. A bit ashy tasting in the finish but nothing that detracts from the experience. The feel is medium bodied, rich and smooth. In all it's pretty typical KBS in that the barrel is invisible. Ditto for any maple in my opinion. I've always been a fan of KBS and appreciate it's simple goodness.

SRM of 24. (4.00) Aroma: Strong aromas of chocolate, coffee, dark chocolate and rich fudge. (4.50) Flavor: Strong flavors of bittersweet chocolate upfront. English chocolate and malt, then some coffee roast and bitterness. Only lasts for half of a second before the sweet wave of rich malt comes forth bringing chocolate fudge, vanilla, caramel, and sweet bourbon booze. Some bitterness lingers, but ultimately sweet. (4.00) Feel: Heavier-bodied, strong carbonation. Bittersweet and roasted, but ultimately sweet. (4.00) Overall: This one drinks with lots of fudge, chocolate, and bourbon booze sweetness. The aromas here are excellent. A decent amount of bittersweet here, but ultimately drinks sweet. The maple syrup doesn't provide much flavor, but provides the sweetness. The flavors here are nice. The sweetness is intense as expected. I think it would drink even better without the maple syrup and tone the ABV down a bit, but just my preference. Glad to finally try this one.

The head is very slow to dissipate and leaves excellent lacing as it does. Smell: Lots of chocolate fudge and semi-sweet chocolate with some underlying coffee notes.  If one tries, very faint scents of the barrel, vanilla, and maple can be picked up.  But one has to really try. Taste: Intense and rich chocolate fudge and semi-sweet chocolate start things off and dominate the sip.  Some maple notes show up mid-sip but they are not overly prevalent.  As in the aroma, bourbon and vanilla notes are here but are quite faint.    Understated notes of coffee and bittersweet chocolate appear later in the sip and stay through the finish.  The alcohol is well hidden. Feel: Smooth, silky and mouth-coating.  A noticeable warmth from the alcohol.  The body is a thin shade heavier than medium. Overall: A excellently done flavored Imperial Stout as one can pretty much expect from Founders.  Quite nice on cold rainy night.  This is pretty much a dessert beer and is a bit too sweet for me to make it a habit, but it will make a good changeup now and again in my winter rotation. Jan 22, 2023 Report",4.34

Attack:  Follows the nose, though appropriately not quite as sweet, though sweetens more as it warms; adequate carbonation.  Coffee. Finish:  Moves to bitterness mostly from the roast, balancing the attack nicely. The maple fudge is more in the nose than the taste.

Head slowly receds to a ring leaving some fluffy lace as it goes. Scent is intense fudge.  Cocoa. Taste is rich thick fudge.  Awesome.  Maple shows up in the very long finish but is much quieter than the fudge notes.  Some cold espresso and roasted notes appear.  Cream.  Vanilla.  Some bitter cocoa notes. Mouth is full, velvety and voluptuous. I've never met a Breakfast Stout I didn't love and this one is no exception.  The vivid and almost absurdly rich fudge notes   - both flavor and scent - leave quite an impression but are balanced by bitter cocoa, roast and espresso which prevent the beer from being too sweet or overwhelming.  The one downside is I do not detect the bourbon notes present in some of its brethren (KBS, CBS) but the fudge makes up for that.  Fantastic stout. Dec 23, 2022 Report",4.54

Some head left behind as the foam dissolves into liquid form. S: Getting notes of bakers chocolate/fudgy chocolate, coffee, maple, similar to sweet caramel. The bourbon is very well hidden in the smell. T: Sweet fudgy chocolate upfront with some slight maple in the middle followed by a coffee taste in the end. Very simple review but the flavors really pop well. What I like the most is that it's a balance between all except the maple. But I have a feeling the maple enhances the flavors of the chocolate to make it sweeter/ more fudgy then normal. F: Medium bodied - easy to drink. ABV for this hides well with the flavors of the beer. The flavors pop so much in this that I really don't mind the body. O: I really enjoyed this beer! This was my second review - which I decided to review room temperature to get the notes better in the beer and it really does taste as amazing as it sounds.

The aroma is so sweet with its roasted dark caramel malts, chocolate fudge, milk chocolate, cream, ash, and a background of earthy hops. Basically no booze for a barrel-aged. The mouthfeel is medium to full and creamy. Just bold. The taste is alive of sweet dark malts and chocolate with a lower profile coffee character. Maybe too sweet for my liking.  Warming.

F: medium body, smooth, coats the tongue, mild carbonation. Would prefer it to be a bit thicker but it’s good. O: not fudge in a bottle but I like that, it’s a stout first and fudge flavored second.

Been on my bucket list since I joined BA. That said, I can’t help but mention being a little underwhelmed. 2024 can poured into a tulip. Beautiful dark obsidian brown with a light milk chocolate tan head. Some glossy lacing on a quick swirl of the glass. Smells slightly boozy and…sigh, sweet. Fudge brownie, light roast coffee, raisinets, chocolate jello puddin’. People have told me that it’s similar to Smuttynose imperial stout which I love(d). Big, bold, roasty, good dose of classic hop bitterness and I believe that it was at one point. But it’s clearly not anymore. In 2014 this beer registered at an abv of 9.8. In 2015 it made the jump to 11.5. 2016 found its current status at 12. I assume this an other components of the beer have been changed to suit the modern palate in terms of abv, bitterness and ‘beetus. The hop bitterness is still there but it’s just overwhelmed by cloying sweetness. I can taste a bit of the old school Smuttynose (and GD Yeti vibes) but it’s what I assume to be a shell of the greatness it probably used to be. Semisweet chocolate, choco covered coffee beans, hersheys syrup, a bit of tootsie roll, and oh yeah, a whisp of that lingering, old school bittering hop flavor on the finish. The sugar is too strong in the end though and it covers the bitterness like paper over rock. The body of this beer is almost right in my wheelhouse for impy stouts. Medium carb but Just slightly more syrupy than I’d like. Man I wish I could’ve tried early versions of this beer. Happy to have finally tried it, but it’s gonna be a bit of a chore to finish on my own. Jan 28, 2025 Report",

I liked the fact that this was not necessarily as sweet as some RIS I’ve had, but it threaded the needle by having enough chocolate and toffee undertones to reassure those of us who are turned off by super hoppy/bitter variations.  Finally, it’s just boozy enough to make it a blissful experience on a cold winter afternoon where the wind chill is below 0F.  Normally, one 16 oz can would be enough, but I wish this would have been 50% larger so I could prolong the pleasure. Jan 19, 2025 Report",4.47

The aroma opens with dark roasted malt that is quickly obscured by spent coffee grinds. Some anise and charred wood are followed by molasses as it warms. Burnt malt works with the very bitter espresso flavor. There is some bakers chocolate as well, however, this really is about the malt. The finish has a long, burnt characteristic. It has a full, almost dense, body and the texture of thick felt. The alcohol is high, with light warming, while carbonation is soft.

Dark roast malt aromas of bitter coffee bean and chocolate, along with some cassis, licorice, charred marshmallow. Was expecting an aggressive flavour, but this is surprisingly subdued, tasting most like a silky chocolate gelato; the feel stands out as a soft caress, with a barely there carbonation that somehow manages to work, likely in part due to the full, creamy body; it has some residual sweetness as you'd expect, but it's within reason and makes for a rich dessert; the taste is single-minded, decadent, slightly fruity, milk chocolate, just slightly bitter in the finish. The reality is not nearly as frightening as the packaging - this is a luxurious, focused stout, nicely balanced, with a subtle feel. Feb 24, 2024 Report",4.46

T: a bit of sweetness up front that is slightly milky or sugary, notes of coffee, hints of tartness that suggest cherry but never quite get there, some roasty notes, pleasant savory bitterness in the finish that marries with a milky or vanilla like sweetness. Alcohol is very well masked. M: on the lighter side of full. A little under-carbonated. O: This is a competently executed imperial stout that is simultaneously typical and a bit peculiar. Everything you would expect to be there is there, and other than some small surprises on the nose, there’s not really anything unexpected. What is unexpected however is how equal all the flavors seem to be. Nothing takes pride of place or dominates and the whole  affair seems a bit understated. It feels like it is pulling its ingredient list from the American Tradition and its sensibility from a much older tradition, one that favors something more balanced than aggressive, think more ‘Courage’ and less ‘Stone’ in its temperament if that makes sense. It’s a very good beer, there is nothing that it attempts to do that it outright fails at, but the sum of the parts here is for me, a little underwhelming. Dec 05, 2023 Report",3.46

Canned 09/19/23 (about 2-1/2 months ago) poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at just above fridge temp 12% ABV per can.  The beer pours pitch black with no light penetration and medium brown colored head.  The head recedes to a rocky cap and leaves spotty lacing all over the glass.  The aroma is moderate with notes of bakers chocolate, coffee beans and red berries.  The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with expresso, caramel, berries and dark chocolate followed by slightly ashy, earthy moderate plus bitterness.  The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish.  Overall, world class RIS. Dec 02, 2023 Report",4.33

Enjoyed on 3/3/23. Poured from a 750mL waxed and capped bottled into a snifter. Served lightly chilled. Impenetrable seal brown liquid with a lasting dun collar. Fine lacing; thick viscous legs. Surprisingly good retention. Molasses, chocolate covered cherries, medium-roast coffee, maple candy, and complex malt in the nose. Stale coffee, milk chocolate, weak tobacco, and brown sugar on the palate. Low bitterness, faint grapefruit, but the hops have faded. Flavors are good but a bit flat, though there are few other signs of oxidation. Medium finish with malt balls, loam, and plum pudding. Medium-full bodied, creamy, with decent carbonation. ABV is well integrated. After 15 years this is surely past its prime, but remains a brooding, stately gentleman of an ale. Mar 03, 2023 Report",4.12

While the color of this beer is like pretty much every other stout, what stands out is the glorious, thick and persistent dark tan colored head.  Beautiful looking consistency and excellent lacing.  Rare for me to think of a stout as anything above a 3.75, but this is getting a 4.5 Nose isn't up to the same level as the look, but it's still really nice, highlighted by loads of chocolate, toffee and faint roast. Taste largely follows, but with much more roast & coffee. Body is not quite as hefty as I anticipated. I want to say it's light, but it also feels like a milkshake, and those two things don't seem to make sense together, so I'm not sure how to describe it.  Regardless, this is quite tasty.

An absolute classic RIS, and one that totally caught me off guard when I saw it at the store, just sitting on the shelf. This is also my first beer from Surly so I’m even more hyped. Let’s tackle this massive beast Pours a very dark brown with a finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing There’s still a solid bitterness to this for being 2 years old which is quite surprising to me. I’m picking up on aromas of leafy hops, burnt caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, charred wood, dark roast coffee, light vanilla, and red grape While still bitter in taste, it feels like it’s integrated much better than the nose. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, cocoa powder, charred malt, caramel, vanilla bean, black cherry, sweetened coffee, light earthy hops, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of res grape, black cherry, molasses, milk chocolate, light roast coffee, leafy hops, vanilla bean, sweet caramel, and charred malt A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and lightly boozy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time Oh yeah, this is really good. Warm and complex, it develops over the course of the drink. I’ll have to try other vintages Jan 18, 2023 Report",4.34

I am not suggesting they are added, but they are present in the flavor profile.  This stout is truly remarkable and I am so happy it is available locally (PA) for the first time in forever.

Picked up at Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA.  $ 18.00 (Including tax)/22 oz bottle ($ 0.819/oz) on 18/09/21.  On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home.  Reviewed 09/07/22.  Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Stamped on shoulder of bottle in nearly invisible ink “BOTTLED ON 09/08/20”.  Served at 58.6 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter.  Final temperature 65.6 degrees. Appearance – 3.75. First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), muddy. Body – Brown (SRM 30), opaque.  When rear-lite, limited penetration but deep amber at the edges. Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), initially brown sugar but lightening to fawn as it breathes, high-density, good retention, diminishing to a 0.3 to 0.5 cm crown and complete, rocky cap.  As the head retracts, multiple partial and complete rings of tiny to small bubbles remain. Lacing – Good.  As the level drops, a wide band of tiny to small bubbles grows, separated from the above band by tiny stalactites and stalagmites.  See also above. Aroma – 4 – Moderate fruity malt and chocolate.  No hops, no yeast. Flavor – 4.75 – Begins markedly bitter with malt, although this bitterness ameliorates as it breathes.  Seems pretty straightforward in taste – malt, a little chocolate, no dark fruit, no char, no coffee.  No ethanol (12 % ABV, according to BA, NOT marked on label) aroma or taste.  Good gastric warming.  No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with hops predominating. Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4.25 Looks like pretty much every Impy stout and RIS on the market.  Both the aroma and flavor are uncomplex and good – malt and chocolate – with only a small taste of organic acids edging in at the aftertaste but not pushing out the hops.  The hoppy ending is unexpected and excellent! Jul 09, 2022 Report",4.36

It pours a dark mahogany with a full finger of luxurious, creamy, light mocha head and very thick lacing. It's a great looking pour. On the nose there is rich chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel/toffee, roasted nuts, leather, tobacco smoke, and char.  The taste opens with lots of chocolate, toffee, raisins, and black cherry, along with strong coffee, dark chocolate, and dry barley. The fruit influence is stronger than I anticipated but welcome.  It's also more bitter and hoppy than expected. The Amarillo and Simcoe adds a different dimension. The balance of sweet and bitter is terrific.  Its mouth feel is creamy but not as thick and chewy as other big Russian Imperial Stouts.  The carbonation is appropriate and the 12% ABV is warming.

I traded a bottle of EH Taylor small batch for this bottle of beer, so let's see if it lives up the hype and $50 I paid for the bourbon. It does look spot on amazing. It's super thick but not syrupy in a bad way. This is the kind of stout that beginners would hate and neck bearded beer nerds crave. On the tongue it's super full and soft. Absolutely perfect for the style for me. I'm not getting enough on the nose though to wow me. I get bourbon and chocolate. I smell the typical lovely bitterness of a RIS. Still, it's lacking in the nose for me. Drinking it though everything lives up to the hype. It's less sweet than a typical Goose BCS which set the standard for me back in the day. I can taste the booziness but in a good way. I like high abv stouts where I can taste the alcohol a bit. Why make a bourbon barrel aged stout if the bourbon isn't front and center? What's different and great is that there's also the balance of the base beer. There's a lot of plain old RIS here. Take your best like a Darkness or Expedition and add the bourbon with everything balancing out perfectly. The finish is long and toasty like a good cup of coffee.

The flavor lingers well after the sip with rich, chocolatey cookie flavors.  The body is very full and creamy without ever being syrupy, leading to a very balanced finish.  Overall, a very flavorful and drinkable beer.  One of my favorite BBA Stouts I have ever had, very well balanced flavor and mouthfeel.  Highly recommended. Apr 10, 2022 Report",

Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant, nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory, tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close. Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish. Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation, purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded, sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish. An honest, old-school display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity, composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings, this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure.

Appearance: black bodied stout. 1-2 fingers tall; medium brown head. Big loose bubbles break the head down into a thin cap that drops down to an uneven ring. Booze legs with each sip. spotty lacing on the side of the glass. Smell: While taking the wax off the bottle, I could immediately smell bourbon! Nice bourbon note and heavy barrel char once poured into the glass. Chocolate and smoke. Taste: Bourbon leads this beer with a nice sweetness and the bourbon is also lightly spicy. Dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, & moderately roasty malt profile. Tobacco and leather. Smoke, peat moss, and ashen barrel char begin to build after each consecutive sip; deep earthy and woody character as well. Umami richness in the middle of the stout. Light oxidation notes in the form of soy sauce; it's very faint and does not distract from anything here. Meaty smoke and peat moss finish that lingers for a little while after each sip. Unique flavors here that I don't taste very often in barrel aged stouts; it's rich with mature barrel notes without being overly sweet. Complex. Interesting. Well done bourbon barrel aged stout by Hill Farmstead. Mouthfeel:  Medium bodied stout. Low and adequate carbonation levels. Creamy carbonation. Smooth and rich texture. It's not motor oil and its really great exactly where it is... in regards to this stout's texture. Damon is not at all boozy, but it does have a noticeable warming presence. This stout actually drinks heftier than the 10.5% abv & I do not mean this in a bad way at all. It's a really robust bourbon barrel aged stout and the texture lends itself to this without being abrasive at all. The beer remains smooth from fridge temperature all the way to room temperature. I solo domed this bottle and drank it over the course of two hours, it retained smooth sipping status the entire time. Overall: Well, this beer has eluded me for a really long time. Really excited for the opportunity to finally get to drink it and see what it's all about. I got to try port Damon back in July of this year and I think that I prefer the port barrel version just a little bit more than the bourbon barrel. Hill Farmstead stouts always tend to distinguish themselves from the crowd. It shows that a stout does not need to be sweet to be rich especially when the stout has such great texture.

Jet black with a dark brown head with good retention and lacing. The nose has a lot of dark chocolate, licorice, a little anise, soy, vanilla, a little booze  and plums, a little tobacco. Rich and deep. The palate opens moderately sweet, with plums, dark caramel, dark chocolate and some bourbon. Dark honey, buckwheat honey and licorice follow, with an anise spiciness complementing the bourbon notes. While sweet, this isn't cloying, favoring balance and structure instead ( but what did you expect?). Fruit cake, dessert like and rich, but still approachable and also uncompromising. Flavors of molasses, particularly the bitterness one finds in treacle, temper the sweetness.  Full in body, softly, creamily carbonated, this is spectacular on the palate. Luscious, full,creamy and luxuriating. Sweet on the finish with lingering plum and tobacco to go with the leathery booze note, this is quite stellar. This beer is an older school stout barrel aged in an old school way. The flavors lean heavily on the malt, especially the licorice and tobacco notes, and the barrel provides a little heat but also oxidative softness to the flavor profile. Impressive. Despite my limited description above, there is incredible depth, balance and poise to this beer. May 04, 2020 Report",4.59

A short-lived, bubbly, light pink cap of froth topped the liquid, but it quickly dissolved. Spotty lacing trickled down the glass after the first few sips. The aroma was impressive and very tropical fruit forward. Dank, musty guava notes came through strongest. Lots of overripe mango as well. Touch of passionfruit. The tropical fruit qualities were very reminiscent of those one might find in an IPA. Slightly wheaty. Some tart lime was also detectable. The flavor profile was solid but more sour and acidic than I anticipated. Bit of dry, crackery malts and tartness up front before the fruitiness kicked in. Lemon notes came through strongest and were well matched by a lush, berry-like quality. Slightly wheaty. Touch of passionfruit. I definitely would not pick out the dragon fruit, though I am not very familiar with dragon fruit flavor. More lemony tartness on the back end. A lemon rind-like bitterness lingered after the swallow. Excellent prickly, finely beaded mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. The carbonation gave the beer a light and soft fluffiness on the palate. DFPF (whatever that means) is an enjoyable and refreshing Berliner Weisse with nice fruity notes, although I definitely did not pick up much passionfruit or dragonfruit specifically.

The beer pours an opaque orange amber color with light lacing and fair head retention.  Frankly, after a couple of minutes this looks like a glass of orange juice.  On the nose I get considerable orange citrus, light tropical fruit and dank earth.  This beer smells pretty good.  On the palate however, I'm not hugely impressed.  I'm getting considerable orange citrus and some tropical fruit, but with a noticeable aspirin character on the finish.  The aspirin flavor hurts the beer's drinkability IMHO.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but with some noticeable astringency on the finish.  Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile; the 8% abv. really isn't detectable.  So that's a good thing I guess. Considering the score this beer garners on ba, I was surprised and a bit disappointed with this beer.  There's a lot of citrus and fruit, and the bitterness quotient is pretty low, but the astringency and aspirin character are off putting.

Juicy and hazy in appearance, this had all the characteristics of a typical New England IPA. A nice head topped this off as it was full, settled evenly, and took quite a while to dissipate. One thick ring of lacing remained near the top of my pint glass a there were enough scattered suds the rest of the way down. Lots of tangy citrus, white grape, and dank hops in the nose as the taste was just as smooth as the mellow aroma was inviting. Some fruit cocktail and heavy stone fruit emerged near the back as this was plenty strong and not carbonated all that much. Thankfully, the body was spot-on as indeed, this reminded me of more familiar brews from these parts. Canned on what looked to be 7/25 of last year, that had ""FOG ADVISORY"" written below it as indeed, this was a bit foggy in nature.

Poured into a heavy set spiegelau glass. L: orange, fairly hazy, like a slightly more opaque heady topper, still retains some crystal quality to the color despite the haze, a beautiful beer. I won't make notes on the head, as pouring adds too many variables for this to be diagnostic to the beer. 4.75/5 S: faint malty richness drowned in bushels of hoppy citra goodness. The way the alchemist brewery smells as you walk in but dialed to 10: freshly cut grass, thick resiny grapefruit rind and evergreen, fertile soil after a summer rain. 5/5 T: shattered expectations: the sweet rich malt holds together a bombardment of  hops that does not let up. Bitterness stays upfront and gives context (unlike heady topper where it can sometimes linger), and breaks away into an open landscape of resiny dank grassiness and tropical fruit. Grapefruit is a good descriptor, but its not a juice forward beer, its very green tasting, like Vermont on a spring day! This beer is truly packed with hops but does not overstep its bounds and remains balanced as best it can 4.75/5 F: thick and creamy, feels substantive with a deep malty thickness accentuated by the hoppy haze and medium carbonation 5/5 O: my new favorite beer and its not that close, this is exactly what I'm looking for in a Vermont IPA, rich malts with overwhelming green hoppyness, not too fruity, and a tad bitter. 5/5 Jun 09, 2025 Report",4.89

Reminds me a bit of Double Bastard, though not quite as hoppy, the malt backbone acts in a similar way to countermand the. bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft with a heavy weight. Medium carbonation.

Smell is of lemon with a hint of orange rind along with some herbal notes.  Taste is aggressively bitter at first, but that bitterness is quickly overtaken by the fruitiness.  As that fades, the bitterness comes back in the aftertaste as faint grapefruit rind.  Mouthfeel is interesting - it feels creamy at first, but slips easily down, leaving that mouth-watering rindy finish. I think I can taste a little of the weed flavor that's in Heady, but here it takes a backseat to the fruit. Overall a very impressive DIPA - a rare (and perfectly executed) combination of West Coast bitterness with NEIPA fruit.  The alcohol is well hidden too. Update---  A month on, and the beer has gone  up in my estimation.  The first time I tried it, it tasted like an an Alchemist IPA with the bitterness dialed back a little.   Now it tastes like a NEIPA with a reasonable amount of bitterness, which is (somewhat ironically) the sweet spot for me, occupied by beers like Fiddlehead IPA and Tree House Green.

After 7 years it’s tough to even parse how the pieces are coming together: is ethyl butyrate throwing subtle fruit notes? This is more about fruit, wood + sly spikes of sweetness - if you want, say, golden raisin sugar or dried apricots, they are there. Also worth appreciating all the things other gueuzes do wrong that this doesn’t: not aggressively acidic, thin, too fizzy or too dead, too bracingly funky. I can’t say for certain how much more nuanced or complete this is vs regular strength Oude Geuze. And what’s challenging is how different it is from most other Gueuzes; sips almost more like Basque cider. I think this needs cheese and an outdoor table - a different context than your usual sour sipping session. Falls firmly into the “so good, it changes your idea of what beer can be” category, but - like many of those - I respect it more than I actually enjoy it. An idiosyncratic gem.

This specific blend has up to four-year old lambic at the time of bottling and the final blend comes from four different barrels and six different beers. As expected, this is difficult to describe.

Very good retention. Subtle yet complex aroma - herbaceous and floral with a delicate funk bringing to mind superior washed rind cheese. Palate entry brings to mind alfalfa fields, sorrel, and salty sea breezes. Tart but not bracingly so. Low earthy bitterness comes and goes. Goat milk, lanolin, crisp malt, and raw nuts. Finishes dry with earth, minerality, umami, and a hint of funk. Medium-light bodied, well carbonated, nearly refreshing, but still soft.

Slight strings of lacing. Aroma is a complexity of funk, fruit and oak. The funk is musty and hay-like, the fruit is remindful of green apples, and the oak adds to both the slight sweetness and the tannins. Taste is also complex, and sour in tone. The mustiness comes through in the funk notes, and the fruit has green apples that add to the sour tone. Big oak underlay. Rather quick to disperse and dry. The fruit funk lingers.

Lost my review three damn times due to page crashing. Now this will be a short review for a phenomenal tasting, which is annoying. Pours a honeyed golden orange. No real head to speak of, but a nice white ring surrounds the glass. Complex nose that you need to smell yourself to truly experience it. Fruit notes of green apples, pears. Funky notes of general barnyard stuff, hay, some musty notes in there as well. Somewhat of a vinous smell, generic dark wine grapes here. Some wooden and oaky aromas. The smell is not an unrestrained Brett/super barnyard funk that smells like a horses barn that hasn’t been cleaned and smells like crap, and it’s not sour vinegar-y either. It’s even mildly sweet. Taste of apricots on the sip that morph into a green apple flavour. Some dried lemon and tangerine peel notes here, I think it’s the drying effect on your palate that give me that impression. Ever spritz a citrus peel and lick the peel itself? That kind of oily flavour is here, but it’s miles more gentle. A little bit of wheaty notes here as well, like some damp, whole wheat bread made with sprouted grains or something. Vinous character at times, like generic white wine grapes. It sort of dances between a lot of different flavours, and yet all of them meld together on each sip. It’s more like, on a particular sip a certain dancer does their solo before blending back in. It’s pretty remarkable all things considered. Some gentle leather like flavours that are sometimes accompanied by… a mild smoke flavour? I might just be shooting blanks here, but it feels like it. There is not, well… I don’t think it’s a savoury character to this. But there is this kind of umami flavour to it. Sort of like the character of blue cheese or yogurt, that sort of body. It’s not oily, particularly, because the sourness makes it more tart than anything. It’s really hard to nail down this character, especially as it warms and it comes out even more. Thankfully… I have another in the cellar! Definitely sour, but not a puckering sour. There is even a mild sweetness. It finishes pretty dry, and surprisingly, finishes quite clean as well. No lingering sourness on the palate. Maybe some very mild fruits and the slightest hint of sweetness, which is really unique from a lot of sour beers I’ve tried. Good carbonation that creates a smooth sip, the carbonation is not particularly biting. Medium bodied. This is my first real Geuze. I’ve had plenty of sours, but not a Geuze as of yet. And I’ve had plenty of terrible farmyard funky sour vinegar bombs that taste like they added 10 gallons of brettanomyces. This is not that. This is balanced, restrained and yet complex. For what the style is, it feels like an absolute benchmark. I am by no means an expert in this arena, but this is quite an experience for any beer drinker. My bottle was bottled early 2018. Which made this about 4 years old when I drank it. I have a second one I plan to age for another 4 years or so! Can’t wait to revisit it! To tide me over until then, I have many other 3 Fonteinen beers to try… the framboise may be next! Mar 14, 2022 Report",4.55
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Reviewed by Harrison8 from Missouri 4.49 /5 rDev 0% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Pours a foggy, hazy burnt orange with a half finger of white fizzy foam. Head bubbles away quickly. Aroma is peach and apricot for fleshy fruits, but not overly juicy. It adds just a touch of initial sweetness. Stone, grass, and oak round it out. It has a slight tart funk to it, but is not 'sour'. Acidity remains balanced, and low. Flavor profile is stone, oak, grass, herbal, peach and faint apricot. It leads with that heavy stone, grassy, yeasty character, with a little build up of fruits at the finish. Tartness remains light or faint, offering just a touch of dynamic at the end. Acidity is low. Mouth feel is still in effervescence with just a little sparse pulp for any additional texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a sublime lambic that packs elegance into every sip. It's not big, bold, or brash, instead developing an endearing personality. Vintage 17|18, Blend n23.

S: musty earth/wood, bright acidity, mild citrus, wood, grain, and apple notes. T: follows the nose with musty/damp flavors and soft citrus, with the addition of darker grain/dark bread flavors. I get a touch of dark fruit followed by a cider-like note in the finish and apple skins in the aftertaste. There’s a earthy spice throughout along with a lingering funk to the aftertaste. M: frothy, creamy carbonation complimented by acidity that is sharp but quick. Medium body with a little chew to it. Not bone dry or thin. Acidity lingers but this drinks well. But if you want a few of the last sharp corners rounded off, give this a few more years of age. This is still pretty bright for 5 years.

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Reviewed by FBarber from Illinois 4.57 /5 rDev +1.8% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Pours a cloudy opaque brownish tinged orange color. Very thin, fleeting off-white head appears as the beer is poured, but dissipates almost instantly. The aroma on this is very complex - there is a moderate funkiness on the nose that is immediately noticeable. Notes of tart green apple, white grapes, oak, dirty laundry, and a zippy lemon character. The taste leans into the funk without as much of the tartness. There are notes of green apples, apple, lemon, some bleu cheese notes, strong oak with some mellow white grapes, wet blanket funkiness and some dry tannic notes. I feel like I get something else every time I take a drink of this beer. At times its funkier, and times it more fruity and tart, then it is drier and leans into that chardonnay like character. The complexity of this is amazingly balanced by a drinkability I have rarely found in these geuzes. I could actually envision drinking this all afternoon rather than just a single glass - although my heartburn would undoubtedly make me regret that. Still, this is a beautiful beer - complex, yet approachable. The feel is medium bodied with bright, vibrant carbonation. The tartness in this dances up to the point of being puckering without ever actually reaching that point. It is definitely a drier beer especially on the back end into the finish. Overall its a remarkable beer - delicious, complex, challenging, yet oddly drinkable. A fitting beer to carry the name of Armand Debelder Mar 06, 2022 Report",4.57

Pours a hazy amber orange color with a finger of sudsy off-white head. Minimal retention. Leaves a nice ring of lacing around the top of the glass. Tons of funk and earthy notes right off the bat. There's a good amount of white wine grapes and vinegar, grass, damp hay, oak chips, and lemon. There's a hint of sweet citrus, almost like clementines, with some very faint cracked pepper. Not overly complex, but definitely an enticing aroma. The flavor builds on the nose, adding a sweet, almost honey like character. Lots of citrus, funk, and oak. There's a subtle nutty flavor lingering in the back. Plenty of vinegar acidity, with a touch of tart cherries and raspberries. The feel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Sharp, crisp bite, with a relatively dry finish. The acidity lingers a bit on the palate before the sheet gets pulled. Overall, this is a great Lambic that's full of flavor and balance. It doesn't quite have the ""Wow"" factor that I expected, but it's still a well-crafted and highly drinkable beer. Complex, but not overly so. Accessible enough for people unfamiliar with the style.

This is currently the 7th highest rated Gueuze, and the 185th highest rated beer overall. I’m making slow but steady progress on trying the top 250. Anyhow, I’m excited for this one and I’m in the mood for something funky so this is perfect. Picked this up at Julians in Providence yesterday while I was getting takeout on lunch break. Let’s pop it open Pours a cloudy orange gold with just a finger of white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing Oh yeah, that’s super funky in the nose, a bunch of earthy notes all coming together. I’m picking up on aromas of white pepper, wet hay, white wine vinegar, apple skin, old leather, sharp oak, lemon rind, and straw Surprisingly, there’s not too much depth to the flavor on this one, the nose was quite misleading. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon rind, sharp oak, light vinegar, and straw. The swallow picks up a bit thankfully, bringing notes of apple skin, wet hay, pear, white pepper, old leather, and minerally white wine A medium body pairs with fine tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp tart beer. Finishes mostly dry with an intense funk I liked this well enough, but nothing that actively amazed me.

Served fairly cold into pint glass. 2018/19 vintage with a best before date of late 2038. Cost was $14.25 CDN. One bought to celebrate a house close, the other for some event in the future. Listed at 7.1% ABV. Super stoked to get a couple bottles from this world famous (2nd most famous?) lambic creator. Blend 13. Appearance - Hazy rich coppery gold brew with a small half finger of white head that fizzles out in a minute or two. Even some reddish hues to this brew. Smell - Complex! Starts with hints of balsamic vinegar, but there's a woody and smoky undercurrent. Orange marmalade fits in there. There's a mustiness and something like rich leather. Some earthy barnyard funk fits in there. Other fruits, maybe apricot or peach show vaguely for an instant. A lot going on, but it's like a pleasant journey with the senses rather than an assault. As it warms... something perfumey or floral that I can't quite put my finger on. Taste - hints of vinegar again, orange marmalade with a light smoky flavor. Leather mixed in as well with some sweetness from apricots. A sprinkle of white pepper at the back end and all this wrapped around a slightly musty and earthy body. Kind of surreal with how much is going on. Overall, tart but not overpowering. Mouthfeel - Medium-light bodied, bright expressive carbonation. Booze quotient is invisible until it hits the back of the throat, then you realize there's some booze here. Light tingly sensation. Initially moist but then finishes quite dry. Overall - Wonderful brew, super duper complex. This isn't a style I have tons of experience with nor is it a favorite style, however I can certainly respect and enjoy (some of) the complexities and nuances of this brew. While Gueuzes have always been a complex style full of nuance this Cuvee blended by Armand & Gaston ramps it up to a whole new level. Definitely worth the purchase and I very much look forward to drinking the second bottle some years into the future and providing a comparison. What a brew. Update October 14, 2024. 2019/20 Vintage with a bottling date of 3/12/2020 and a best before of 2040. Listed at 7.6% ABV. Not much to say but the notes hold up with the orange marmalade, must and pepper accents being noticeable. Super complex and a journey. Well worth the price of admission. Sep 13, 2021 Report",4.42

Bottled in June 2018. Best by October 26, 2038!? Maybe I am 27 years early? A translucent orange with pink highlights, little to no head or lace.  No sign of yeast poop or sediment. The aroma is  slightly sour, cherry, pear…there’s something lurking underneath, can’t quite place it.  A flavor surge commences, slightly sour, olive, pear/apple cider. The initial olive notes  fade a couple sips in. Whatever was lurking in the aroma starts appearing in the finish as it warms. Some type of funk or oak? Pear orange and pepper notes strengthen while maintaining a moderate amount of sourness.   The feel is medium, carbonation medium high with a sharp finish. Everything melds together as it warms. Still learning to gauge this style. Worth a go. What does this develop into after 30 years? I can’t properly cellar anything that long (a year is a success) , though I may grab another one and try.

Bottled June 26th 2018.   Season 17/18  Blend no. 66. Deep orange bodied, opaque, but with a great tangerine glow, faint edge haze as well.  Nice amounts of side carbonation, very fine almost microscopic, making the glass move when observed from a distance.  Off white head, dissolves to a standard pencil thin white collar, not a very active center puck, only mildly.  Still very nice looking gueuze, not the best I have seen from Drie F, but certainly fine. What the beer doesn't excite in appearances, it so far makes up in spades in aroma.  Even sitting at a distance it hits me.  Big funk, sharp marmalade and white pepper notes coming off in big quantities.  Flirts with tangerine like orange, hits of fireplace ash as well among the pepper like nose too.  Seems to stay away from complexity and bold fruit, but it's classic profile is very nice. Palate just provides a golden touch.  Liquid soft bodied, with a hint of light bubbled carbonation that cuts a joyful rich body.  Pepper ash and a big citrus funk in the mid palate, lemons, tangerine, more marmalade sprinkled with muted pepper warmth and heat.  Silky finish, nearly honey like feel.  Finish gets more orange centered in flavor, with a juicy quality mixed with excellent funky character. Reading the bottle, spring honey added, woah didn't expect that!  May not be the most exciting of the makers products, but is pure liquid gold in the glass. May 16, 2021 Report",4.47

Look-  Deep brown, dark brown creamy head, opaque, large visible particulate at the margins, above average head retention, average lacing. Smell-  Maple syrup, coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, high strength of scent. Taste-  Roasted malt, coffee, maple syrup, artificial tasting, high strength of flavor. Feel-  Between medium and full body, average carbonation, highly creamy, highly bitter, silky, moderately mouth warming, mildly mouth coating. Overall-  Appearance could not have been better.  Nose was a strong maple syrup and had a high intensity.  The flavor was very coffee forward, but had a very artificial quality to it.  The feel was nice, but not much mouth coating property.  I first had this beer on 1-13-2020 and rated it, but didn’t review it.  My rating back then was substantially higher (L-5, S-4.75, T-4.5, F-4.75, O-4.75) with an overall score of 4.67.  I remember the nose being more vibrant and the flavor having no artificial character.  The current version of this beer was still good, but nowhere close to as good as I remember.

Ample lacing. Strong maple presence on the nose, almost akin to nosing straight syrup. Coffee is there and hints of caramel. Taste makes sure the coffee is known and balances out the abundant maple sweetness. Dark chocolate shows up late and carries through to the finish. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, silky and creamy. Finish is dark chocolate and more maple. The 11% ABV is well-hidden. While this skirts the line of a dessert beer fridge-temp to say 50 degrees, this turns more into a dessert beer as it warms; the mouthfeel goes more oily and sweetness amps up.

The head fades very fast leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is huge of a coffee and dark chocolate smell mixed with lots of roasted malt and toasted bread.  Along with these aromas comes a good deal of sweet, forward in maple syrup with a nice backing of molasses and brown sugar.  Along with these aromas comes big notes of char and a strong showing of vanilla and crème rounded out by a bit of wood. Taste – A very sweet roasted malt flavor greets the tongue.  There is a very strong sweetness of maple syrup, toffee, and brown sugar upfront, with the maple getting even more potent as the taste moves forward.  At the same time there is a good showing of toasted and roasted malt along with a strong presence of coffee.  The coffee is lighter upfront, getting a bit stronger and adding some bitter to balance the sweet.  All the while some of the wood, booziness and char make themselves known, and with the mix of flavors left at the end, one is left with a very sweet and fairly roasty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body is very thick and syrupy with a light and mild carbonation level. For the very heavy tastes and sweetness of the brew, the body is nice making for a dessert like sipper. Overall – A little too sweet for my taste, almost cloyingly so.  If you like a very sugary stout this will be for you, but if a drier or roastier imperial stout is more your speed, you may want to avoid. Dec 29, 2024 Report",3.79

No canning date; consumed 1-27-24. Beer poured black with a very nice tan head. Nose is very nice with a beautiful combination of coffee and maple. Taste is very well done as a large malt base gives notes of mild roast and a touch of chocolate.  The coffee and maple adjuncts are woven in very well.  Finishes just a tad sweet but definitely not cloying. Mouthfeel is medium to large bodied and very smooth. Overall a delicious brew, glad i was able to give it a try! Jan 27, 2024 Report",4.34
Double Stack,"Reviewed by TheBricenator from Oregon 4.36 /5 rDev -2.9% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25 Look: Pours like motor oil and black as night with a quick-forming brown head that rises and slowly settles to a silky-looking lid, leaving minimal lacing behind Aroma: Roasted tree nuts, roasted barley, bakers cocoa, maple syrup, cold-brewed coffee, caramel, light earthy notes, piloncillo, and warm brown bread. No alcohol heat detectable Taste: Whoa. Opens up with a rush of roast, roasted barley, and cocoa that sucker punches the palate before mellowing some and developing depth. Waves of coffee, maple syrup, and tree nuts crash in to join, each shining for a moment on their own before blending into the mix nicely. Earthiness and piloncillo peek in from time to time throughout and closes with chocolate, coffee, brown bread, and maple syrup, along with just a kiss of ethanol Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, medium carbonation, and smooth and full on the finish with a touch of dryness Overall: This is some tasty stuff. I’ve wanted to try this for a couple years now but hadn’t fully committed to buying it until now as it looked to be odd and unique but maybe not good enough to warrant a full serving which, as I now can say, it is. This reminds me a lot of a bourbon barrel aged Imperial Stout except with the bourbon swapped out for maple syrup and coffee and it isn’t too one-sided nor overly sweet enough for me to only want a few sips. Super fun to try and drink, plus a sneakily hidden 11% ABV. Definitely worth trying to those who think they would be into it as it made a believer in the hype out of me Dec 10, 2023 Report",4.36
Double Stack,"Reviewed by teromous from Virginia 3.67 /5 rDev -18.3% look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5 From the bottom of the can: ""SEEING DOUBLE 09/28/23"" Appearance: It is a black bodied beer with a very short light tan head that quickly fades into nothing. There are a few pock-marks across the still black surface of the beer which look like carbonation bubbles popping, and there is a hairline ring of tan carbonation, but mostly the surface is devoid of a head and the glass is absent of lacing. The label on the can states that this is ""ALC/VOL 11.0%"" so it is reasonable for there to be no head or lacing. Aroma: Even when just pouring the beer from the can into the glass the room was filled with the scent of maple syrup. Approaching the glass it smells like a diner where everything in the booth smells like maple syrup. It smells nice but it only smells like maple syrup. Taste: Maple comes through at first, then there is this pleasant toasted flavor which starts out good then cranks up to something awesome. It starts out tasting a bit toasted like french toast but then notes of char and caramelized sugar start to join in which does a good job of pumping the maple flavor, which then in turn pumps the caramel flavor. The flavors in the beer work well in synergy. The aftertaste has some carbon which is nice and it also has a bit of green apple which isn't quite as fitting with the rest of the beer. A bit of vanilla flavor sticks around the mouth when the beer is long gone. Mouthfeel: It feels full bodied and there is a bit of a twinge from both the alcohol presence in the beer and a bit of the grain bitterness. It has a bit of slickness on the tongue which works well in its favor. The beer shows its ABV which is advertised at ""ALC/VOL 11.0%"" and as always, unless the presence is overwhelming, the high alcohol content isn't a bother. It lacks the smoothness that competitors have. Overall: The label on the can states that this is an ""IMPERIAL BREAKFAST STOUT"" and that it is an ""imperial stout with coffee, maple syrup, natural flavor and caramel color."" The beer had a definite maple flavor but it lacked the advertised coffee. It doesn't state what the ""natural flavor"" is and it seems odd that a beer with a black body would need ""caramel color"" unless that was a secondary byproduct of another addition, such as the maple syrup or the natural flavor. As a whole the beer was pretty good. The biggest disappointment for this beer was the lack of coffee flavor which this beer promoted. This beer has plenty of sweetness to shoulder up against a more prominent coffee flavor. As a whole I would probably still buy it again because it just tastes good. It isn't the easiest drinking beer but it's nice. I would recommend a single pour or can to try this before committing to a 4-pack. Nov 18, 2023 Report",3.67

Reviewed 14/05/23 (Review 3101). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Top rim of can stamped “STICKY STACKS 03.06.23”. Stored at 34 degrees at home.  Served at 46.2 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F. Appearance – 4.25 First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear. Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque with light penetration at the edges – ruby. Head: Average (Maximum 1.1 cm, aggressive center pour), tan, high density, quickly diminishing, reducing to a 0.2 cm crown constantly renewed by carbonation, and a thin partial cap. Lacing – Poor.  Thin line of near-microscopic bubbles. Aroma – 4.5 – When the tab is popped, instant aroma of coffee and maple syrup!  Weak roasted malt, no hops, no yeast.  No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on the label). Flavor – 3.5 – Moderately bitter coffee with maple syrup flavor as backing.  Bitterness enhanced by the char flavor.  No malt, no yeast, no hops.  No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.  Slight gastric warming. Palate – 4 – Medium; watery short of syrupy/creamy; soft carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4 Without the char bitterness, I would have rated the flavor 4.5; for my taste buds, the char nearly ruined the maple/coffee combo.  Otherwise, this is a very good coffee stout.  And that “natural flavor and caramel color” screams “Unnecessary crap added”. May 14, 2023 Report",3.94

""Sticky stacks"" stamped on the side of the can It's finally time to try this classic from Great Notion thanks to Tavour. It's their most reviewed beer on BA and their only one to have entered the top 250. This should be their magnum opus. Will it be? Let's crack it open and find out Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing This is absolutely a maple bomb in the nose, but the coffee plays a nice supporting role as well. I'm picking up on aromas of maple syrup, milk chocolate, burnt caramel, medium roast coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, and straight up pancakes It's surprisingly much more bitter in taste compared to the nose, not to say that it's super bitter but it has a nice bite. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting raw maple, dark roast coffee, charred malt, vanilla, cocoa powder, molasses, light raisin, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, dark roast coffee, cacao nibs, burnt caramel, charred malt, dark toast, and light molasses A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sweet beer with a bite. Finishes a tad sticky but nothing that hurts the drinkability It's not reinventing the wheel of maple adjuncted Stouts, but it's damn good nonetheless May 13, 2023 Report",

S: Opening the can is like opening the door to a sugar shack as you're met with a wave of maple, followed by bold coffee, roasty malt, a little char, and faint smoke, light earthy notes, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and slightly toasty biscuity bready pancake-y-ness. T: Opens with a huge hit of maple syrup, followed by milk chocolate, vanilla, and a nice touch of coffee that leads into roasty malt, a little char, and a touch of smoke, with underlying mild earthy and slightly nutty notes, toffee, and toasty biscuity/bready malt very reminiscent indeed of a stack of pancakes. M: Full body, somewhat mild carbonation, pretty smooth though somehow I would describe it as especially creamy, alcohol is rather well hidden giving just the slightest touch of warmth as it comes up to room temp. O: I've had a couple cans of this sitting in the fridge for a few years now, just waiting for the right night to crack into my special liquid souvenirs from a great road trip. But as time passed and that night never came, I got on the lookout for a fresh can to purposely do the opposite with; to push to the front of the line as quickly as possible and try fresh. A lucky shipment of cans hit my area recently, so here we are, cracking into a can that's a little more than a month old. This beer probably has the strongest maple presence of any beer I've ever had, including CBS. To their credit, you definitely get the sensation of taking a big bite of pancakes dripping with syrup after just taking a sip of your morning mocha. Unfortunately, that kinda leads into its downfall. While it is true to their own description of having an ""extreme maple syrup flavor"", it can come off as ungodly sweet up front. Not gonna lie, I'm also a little weary of the label saying ""coffee, maple syrup, natural flavor, and caramel color"", potentially meaning there's some kinda maple or 'pancake extract' in there. This one is fun to try, but could really benefit from some balance; upping the coffee, backing the maple down a notch, maybe even both would help make it less of a novelty and more of an enjoyable sipper you go back to. Maybe some age will do the trick. I'll definitely update when that right night comes along and I get into my vintage cans. For now, I'd say it's a cool one to try as a short pour, but it can get overwhelming in greater volumes. Apr 21, 2023 Report",4.19

Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"Reviewed by Smakawhat from Maryland 4.47 /5 rDev -0.4% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.  Canned Sept 12th 2023. Pillow cream top head, bright but also really ice cream like white with a soft top.  Real nice classic three finger height on a controlled pour, with a body color that is flat opaque, and with at least a bit of shiny custard yellow color. Aroma is a hop delicious bonanza.  Juiced up pineapple and orange, moving towards cantaloup and melon flavors also.  Faint touches of grass like herbs that cuts down the sweety fruit aromas nicely.  Lots to explore here, and the malts and yeast stay out of the picture. Palate in every way is just rich.  First sip is creamed orange, hinting even of vanilla like sweetness, and even a milky thick texture.  Blasting but soft controlled herbal grass finish, which leads to excellent sweet mint and sage like aftertastes.  Honey.  Cream. Tangerine and pineapple fruit bowl flavors, in a silky juiced creamy malted feel. Quite a solid amped up and dialed in IPA, with a surprising hop flavored diversity.  Exceptionally done here.

The body is wonderfully dark, as is the dark brown head, while it lasts. The aroma on this is powerful and decadent.

Up close, it's even sweeter, with vanilla, syrup, honey, and brown sugar joining the mix, along with cinnamon and chilies. The nose is, quite simply, wonderful. Despite the sweetness of the nose, the brew is quite roasty and bitter up front. Light but noticeable pepper heat. Tons of dark fruit flavor, blackstrap molasses, oak, and bitter chocolate; slightly vegetal. Lasting prune and raisin, along with bourbon, on back third, leading to chocolate and cinnamon on the finish. Thick and full bodied. Apr 25, 2021 Report",4.46

Immensely dark head of 1plus fingers width dissipates at a moderate rate. Leaves only a few patches of lacing. 4.75 S: Aroma is, my god.  Massive cinnamon, big chocolate, vinous dark fruits, luscious bourbon, capsaicin peppery heat, red wine.  Barrel notes are moderate in strength and compliment the beer wonderfully. Some base beer notes primarily roasted malt. Fire roasted marshmallows rounds it out. Goodness gracious. 4.75 T: Taste is also excellent, albeit perhaps a bit less voluptuous. I again get huge vinous and red wine notes up front, hell is actually tastes like it’s red wine barrel aged.  Next comes the cinnamon and rich, fine high cocoa content dark chocolate.  On the finish there is roasted malt, charred oaky bourbon notes, some balancing bitterness. This is just wave after wave of flavors and it’s quite frankly just impressive.  4.75 M/D: Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick.  ABV is not noticeable which is impressive.  Drinkability, however, is quite limited. The combination of the heavy/thick feel and adjunct laden flavor profile make 500mL of this feel like 3 gallons (and this is coming from someone who drinks Bourbon County all the time and even old school 750mL Black Tuesdays without any trouble). 4 O: Overall, this is quite the beer.  Normally beers this adjunct heavy can be not really my thing, but this one just pulls it off wonderfully.  Probably more appropriate as an 8oz pour as opposed to a 500mL solo bottle, but still, well done Cigar City, well done. 4.5 Mar 18, 2021 Report",4.63

Deep inky black with a heavy finger of dark beige head that recedes to a thick fingernail and sticks around. Aroma of soy sauce and bourbon barrel, some tobacco, and some milk and dark chocolates. Flavor brings heavy alcohol, soy sauce, dark chocolate, tobacco, bourbon barrel, and piney hops. There is some chili pepper in there as well somewhere. Feel is hot, burning, scathing even, and thick with a delicate creaminess that disappears as soon as the heavy carbonation comes forward. Overall, I was hoping my 3,000th beer would be something really special, and this one came a little short of it. I could take more sweetness and molasses overall, this was more just pine, soy sauce, and bourbon barrel. Very cutting and linear. I much prefer the original non-barrel aged version.

Inherits aromas of nacho cheese, almonds, a load of cinnamon and a good amount of oaken, alcohol soaked oak. Carries its spices in a headstrong fashion, leaning on bakers chocolate and green peppers in a very convincing way, enhanced by a gentle toffee sweetness. Drinks initially smooth, with a late carbonation spark, featuring a surprisingly thin body, which feels inappropriate, compared to the beer‘s full swing chili-barrel hotness. Tastes of bakers chocolate, licorice, scented wood and scorched malts from the very beginning. Its boozy barrel character unfolds among equally hot chilies in a burning and challenging fashion, unsuccesfully calmed by a prominent bitter chocolate flavor. Brings alcohol soaked, dried raisins to the palate during its finish, washing away the beer‘s balancing creaminess with a pungent, complex hotness, which gets a dry touch during its finish. Tastes very booze forward, with an uncompromising interplay between chilies and bourbon. By developing such a hot bite, the beer misses out on its smoothness, which the regular version is able to provide. Oct 26, 2018 Report",3.45

Smells of rich, dark chocolate, cinnamon and chili peppers, with a hint of vanilla, oak and quite a hot bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by rich, bitter chocolate, roasted malts and spicy chili peppers, with a good amount of vanilla and lighter notes of cinnamon, dark fruits: fig, raisins, some oak and a light earthiness. There's also quite a hot, boozy bourbon note to this. It starts out a little sweet, with the chocolate and vanilla standing out the most, but turns more a lot more bitter and warming in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness, vanilla notes, and some heat, both from the chili and booze, lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. This thankfully doesn't have that odd, floral chili note that normal Huna has, the chilies feeling a lot more sharp and spicy. A little less earthy and bitter as well, with more vanilla sweetness and a lot more booziness. slightly richer dark fruit notes as well. Mouthfeel is actually quite a bit worse though, not having quite that thick, almost viscous quality to it that normal Huna has. Still quite smooth though. I actually think that the heat from the chilies and the booze work together quite well to create quite an aggressive character works well with the bitterness and is balanced out nicely by a certain sweetness from the vanilla.

Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Reviewed by colts9016 from Idaho 4 /5 rDev -10.7% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4 Review: 2194 Name: Apple Brandy Barrel Noir Brewery: Prairie Artisan Ales Location:  Krebs, OK Style: Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout ABV: 12% Date: Unknown I am shifting to an imperial barrel-aged beer from Oklahoma: Apple Brandy. My brief knowledge of Apple Brandy is that it is a brandy made from apples. I have tried this before, and it has a faint hint of apples. It was distilled to create the brandy. I am still determining if brandy will push through the imperial stout. I am using a tulip glass and serving the beer at 48 degrees. The pour created a creamy, one-fingered, medium-tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The jet-black beer has dark mahogany hues, is charting at SRM 38, and is opaque. The appearance is average for this style. That is interesting. When I first nosed the glass, the beer had a faint apple aroma, along with alcohol, chocolate, oak, and coffee. Nosing the glass several times, I detect bread, roasty, lightly toasted malts, molasses, earthy, light smoke, char, raisins, and floral. The beer has a lovely malt complex accompanied by a heavy barrel aging. I was expecting an elaborate nose, but it is straightforward. The beer did not hold up in the cellar; it was vinegar. I am going to close this review and give the beer an average rating, and I will come back to it if I can get a hold of another one. I did not detect the vinegar in the nose, and when I sipped the beer, I was stunned and said, "" it has turned. Sep 09, 2024 Report",

I’ll get to the appearance at the end of the review, mostly because the smell and taste are the two most important parts of this beer and for one other reason. Smell is boozy barrel up front with a healthy amount of warm apple to round it out. Taste is more balanced, with the apple slightly leading the way and the boozy oaky barrel subtly surrounding it. Feel is medium bodied, neither oily nor thick-a perfect example of “just right”. Mouth watering, drinks more like a non-barrel aged 9 or 10% abv than a big bold 12. My only  problem, however, was evident right off the open and pour. I opened it and got hit with the apple and brandy before the cap came off, but I didn’t hear the usual noise one expects opening a beer, because the one I had had little to no carbonation. It has a nice dark hue with some brown edging, but there was no foam and very little lacing. If they date their beer with the first three numbers being the date, this was bottled 9/26/18. Doing a little online research, in October of last year, there was a release by Prairie that some of this beer was infected, so I don’t know if that’s the case here. But if this beer infected just means the loss of carbonation, I’d take an infected version of it over a lot of other beers out there. Because this is phenomenal! Long time want, glad I got it.

Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Reviewed by bobracecar from Oklahoma 3.12 /5 rDev -30.4% look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5 I had the original by the tulsa boys. I thought and still think it’s the best beer I ever had. This new one is a let down. First smell was that apple juice dominated over everything else. That was odd and off putting compared to the original. First taste was rewarding that it seemed balanced like the original. Then the big let down came into play. The mouth drenching aftertaste of apple juice plagued my mouth. This is not a barreled apple brandy. If it is it is way over powering of the bomb like base that seems balanced at first. The actual brandy alcohol seems even lost to me from the apple domination. Is this a bad beer? No. Is this the best beer I ever had ? No. I even doubt the 12% abv and would rate lower around 10%. I took no measurements though. It’s just not as rich and balanced as the original, plain and simple. Considering this is my favorite beer ever. Please try again. I will applaud the extra effort.

The super round, lusciously fluffy medium-full body delivers creamy fresh vanilla whip swirled into the smooth presence of medium roast coffee exhibiting big punches of dark chocolate morsels all gliding along a tingly carbonation that recedes into a just semi-dry finish. The longer I dig in, the chocolatier and fluffier it gets, developing further hints of mocha liqueur and crystalized toffee or even peanut brittle, while also becoming a little sticky on the lips. There's a little bit of a charred brown sugar element you might experience in Mexican coffee, and as the lactose builds on the palate it becomes tough to drink, even splitting the bottle with my old lady. I just couldn't wait to duo dome this bottle with her as fresh as possible after this b2 release, and it was not a disappointment.  There's no question why this beer set off Trillium's pastry stout odyssey, as this b2 is no slouch and still the best pastry stout they've put out (with Biscotti & Coffee and BA Affogato being my other tops).

I am sure this will get great reviews as with everything Trillium but I think most good breweries brew better. Perhaps this ages better. Looks great. Dark, creamy, little head that dissipates soon enough. For an ""affogato"" it sets some expectations. Smells Good. Yes, you get the coffee, chocolate and vanilla but the smell gives you the first hint that this is going to be a disappointment. Stouts with lesser alcohol smell better and there are many good coffee and chocolate stouts out there. First taste is really good. The smell has muted your expectations. The vanilla is there, the coffee not so much. I am guessing they do that to get a better audience but this is an ""affogato"" with a blend of coffee. There's more of chocolate notes so that's a plus. The aftertaste is too sugary though. By the second sip, a pint seems like a lot but I have been served at the brewery and the taste doesn't live up. Probably needs less alcohol with less sugar and more of a mouthfeel to get a better balance and flavor profile. I can see that this was a great beer when it was introduced a few years ago but it needs an update. The limited drop is a great way to get good ratings. Try this if you are in the Boston area. If you are making a trip, head to Wakefield in the opposite direction instead. Your local brewery probably makes a better pastry stout. Oct 24, 2020 Report",3.83

Taste - a bit of coffee and dark chocolate but no coconut, the surprise was a chunk of something, must have been solidified coconut, that got trapped in my mouth and quickly dissolved.

This is an incredibly delicious candy bar masquerading as a beer. Appearance is probably the only weak point. Huge coconut, cinnamon, toffee, chocolate, bourbon nose and taste.

June 2018 Update Had a 2017 vintage from a 16oz growler poured recently at Barrels & Vines. Very much the same as original review with cinnamon a bit more pronounced, slightly less alcohol but every bit as good as I remember. Maybe even creamier than I recal. A great beer. Have a few more 2017 in the cellar. Can’t wait! Didn’t get any 2018 as it was taproom only release which wasn’t practical for a SE MI beer lover. 2017 vintage (orange ball). Pours a dark brown with a small head that took some work. Minimal lacing, low carbonation. Sweet smell with a delicious aroma I can't place. Maybe toasted coconut (which I don't normally like) with brown sugar. Definite booziness but very smooth nonetheless. Sweet right at the start but chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, other spices combine with bourbon and oak. One of the more complex and wonderful tastes I've experienced. Maybe a bit on the sweet and boozy side but I love it. Gets better as it warms. Mouthfeel is amazing. Substantial complexity with low carbonation that suits me just right.  Like the taste, it gets better as it warms. Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a bit sweet but not overdone.

Nose is full of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, dark fruits and chocolate milk. I didn’t detect any coconut but still found this to be very complex and enjoyable to inhale. Flavor has a lot more dark fruit, toffee and sweetness to it like black cherry soda along with brown sugar and a melted Heath Bar. It almost borders on cloyingly sweet, but that aspect helps hide the 15% ABV. Like the nose I got of barrel or oaky notes, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, more dark fruits, cocoa powder, candy and chocolate milk. None of the coconut advertised on the bottle, but a dynamic profile that was a lot more balanced than I expected. A tad bit thin, even for a porter, and while it’s overall a very impressive brew it’s too sweet to drink a bomber by yourself as I struggled having it alone.

The frothy foam slowly falls and lacing is sparse with some webs and sheets. S- The dark roasty grains really shine here with deep cocoa powder, pure roast barley, espresso and char notes. With warmth the barrel and coconut open up quite a bit but in the end the aroma is rather balanced. Toasty coconut, oaky vanilla, smooth bourbon, milk chocolate, slight dried dark fruits, sugar and toffee. T- This is a big boy. Honestly doesn't drink even close to 15% with the coconut and roasted grains coming out as the main flavors in the brew. Luscious toasted coconut and medium dark chocolate leads into vanilla oak bourbon, dark roast coffee, charred grain, toffee, slight dark dry fruits, toasted nuts, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla bean, fresh toasted woody oak and peppery whiskey. MF- Massive thickness to this dark oily monster. Slick and sweet syrup with a rich and frothy consistency. Ends warm but this is smooth. Coconut joins in on a huge amount of roasty grains and a flavorful bourbon barrel. Vanilla, chocolate, coffee and coconut monster. Jan 28, 2019 Report",4.49

But that’s definitely all there is on the scent of this one, it covers up any chocolate or coffee that may be lying beneath it cold. The taste is YUUUGE coconut up front which is followed closely by decadent sweet chocolate, light roast coffee, and some lactose. Mouthfeel is decadent, not quite chewy, but nosing right up to it.

Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass. Purple bowling ball (2016 bottle). A: Very dark brown, nicely opaque, with a thin tan head that fades to a ring along the sides. Low visible carbonation. S: Big bourbon up front, with less, but still big, oakiness. As the bourbon punch fades the coconut, vanilla, and chocolate malts show up. Roasted malts, cacao, mild char, and dark roasted coffee. Light tobacco as well. Definitely booze-forward, but yet still not a particularly ""alcoholic"" smell. Really nice here. T:  Chocolate and bourbon, vanilla and coconut. Oak tannins and sweetness, with milk chocolate and roasted malts. Some ethanol burn, drying tobacco, and notes of caramel and milder sorghum. Then more coconut. A mild roast bitterness and milder hop bitterness near the end, but ultimately fails to even come close to balancing the sweetness – chocolate with coconut plus the vanilla swells at the end, but some bourbon sweetness ultimately wins out after the swallow. O: A nice thick body for a porter, although this seems like a “porter” in name only. The alcohol is quite prevalent, albeit very well-hidden for anything claiming to be 15%. Low carbonation sensation, but seems fitting for this beer. O: This is quite good. A nice coconut and chocolate and bourbon balance. But it's pretty sweet – and that comes from a guy in Florida used to CCB, Angry Chair, and Cycle stouts. I wish there was just a little more bitterness here – whether from the roast or hops I wouldn’t care. It’s not quite disagreeably cloying, but even splitting the bottle two ways the sweetness is just a little more than I was looking for. Nov 02, 2018 Report",4.24

There is a date of Winter 2023 on the bottom of the can, and I drank this about 1 month after I purchased it. Appearance: Very dark black with 1-finger head. The head was dark brown, and disappeared after a minute. It left only a little lacing on the glass, and no head remained after a minute. Smell: Strong mix of aromas filled the room as soon as the can was opened. Roasted coffee, caramel, and chocolate aromas. Not much hop style citrus or pine aromas. Taste: There is taste of coffee, chocolate, and licorice. Also, some vanilla, peanut butter, and roasted malt flavors. They are more balanced than I expected from the aroma. Flavors are very bold. There is a strong alcohol presence that matches 7.6% advertised.  A sweet chocolate, and vanilla aftertaste with edge of coffee, that is really enjoyable. Mouth-feel: Very thick, but with an extremely smooth and creamy body. This is a very good Porter, and one of the best Porters I have ever drank.  It has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. The balance of flavors is outstanding. The flavors of coffee and roasted malt nicely balance the bitter coffee with the sweet chocolate and caramel flavors.  This is even better than the Tree House Cartharsis Porter, which is very good.  This is very smooth and enjoyable to drink. I have enjoyed all the beers I've bought at Tree House, and I would buy this again. Feb 26, 2023 Report",4.56

Indicates YEAR THREE on the can with a date of 1/7/22, so this is being consumed at just after 3 months. Look: Pours out very dark brown almost black with a deep brown colored, frothy head.  The head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a thin layer behind.  Looks stunning. Smell: The aroma is wonderful.  This smells like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup.  Notes of roasted hazelnuts and charcoally coffee also.  There's even a subtle green bell pepper and licorice aroma on the finish, which is very interesting for a milk stout. Taste: Interesting.  It is much sweeter than I was expecting.  And that's appropriate, because this is a milk stout.  I think it's just that from the nose, I expected it to be not as sweet as it is.  The mouth mirrors the nose, but perhaps the peanut butter flavor on the palate is much more subtle than in the aroma.  Also, a lot of the sweetness is perceived to have an artificial sweetener vibe that is less than ideal for me.  The finish is long and has a nice roasty, charcoally chocolate/coffee flavor. Feel: Mouthfeel is relatively thick.  This is smooth and chewy.  Carbonation is spot on.  Really nice. Overall: This is my first Tree House beer that was not a New England IPA.  This beer reminds me a lot of another peanut butter milk stout that I enjoyed: Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing.  One of the differences is that Gunner's Daughter does not have coffee and that Hold On To Sunshine is higher ABV.  Overall, this is a really great coffee milk stout.  It was hard to choose between a 4.25 and 4.5 overall; in the end, I gave it a 4.25 because the artificial sweetener taste knocks it down slightly for me. Apr 08, 2022 Report",4.34

M: Sweet and sticky with a slight drying edge. T: Like eating a full Reese's cup after taking a shot of espresso, which i just did for comparison purposes. Overall, the chocolate is more enduring than chocolate. Red berry chocolate fruitiness counterbalances the earthy peanut. Dryness of the short espresso.

Aromas of fragrant coffee abound, sporting a vanilla inflection and subtle roast atop a delicate maple saturation; a deft cinnamon edge presents through the back end of the bouquet while a soft bourbon inflection lingers. Taste features airy cocoa touched with coffee roast, with a touch of vanillins imbuing a char revisited over the mid-palate; soft maple settles into the back end, informing heavy dark cocoa into the finish as supportive cinnamon fades through the swallow. Mouthfeel offers a medium body and moderate carbonation, fading as subtle roast coats and a slick, balancing texture washes over the mid-palate; creaminess into burgeoning warmth settles through the back end while a wispy, semi-bitter prickle finishes. Expressive coffee welcomes sleek vanilla, with bourbon simultaneously softening roast and mediating a beautifully deft cinnamon accent; an expertly done combination of adjuncts, layered over the profile approachably and with purpose.

Kane Brewing's pick-me-up and put-me-down Imperial Porter means that you can have that Sunday brunch anytime you'd like. Bourbon Barrel Aged Sunday Brunch is a bold and dark ale that pours with a scant froth and a near-black appearance to achieve the look of a dark roasted coffee. Its decadent and roasty scent immediately strikes the nose with maple, bourbon spice, cocoa and coffee. Its strong malty taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple, molasses, caramel, candied coconut and vanilla. And that decadence continues across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to a robust. dark roast coffee, walnut, dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream, and ushers in a bittersweet taste with nuances of charred oak, coconut, peppery whisky and a woodsy bitterness to offset the lingering malts. Full in body, the lavish porter is mild enough in texture to mimic the feel of a nougat, suggared espresso bean, except with a hot chocolate under current. Spiced with a bourbon inspired glaze, the oaken attitude of charred woods and peppery tannins play a sweet and spicy tune on the after palate. Jan 19, 2022 Report",4.21

Thin head fades quite quickly.  Big maple syrup aroma, followed by chocolate and coffee.  Barrel aroma is faint.  Tastes like the original Sunday Brunch, with an additional depth to it via barrel aging.  Flavor is dominated by maple syrup;  cinnamon follows quickly, and finishes with a touch of coffee.  Cinnamon adds a gritty dimension to it, and becomes pervasive as it warms.  The bourbon barrel treatment doesn’t offer a lot in this beer unfortunately.  Just a little extra chocolate and mellowness.  Carbonation is light, and it feels thin, has a bit of a tanginess to it.  Overall, not an exceptional BA beer from Kane, I expected a little bit more from the barrel program than this. 1/26/20 500 ml bottle released 1/25/20 4.25 rating Jan 26, 2020 Report",4.29

Not very much lacing. -Very sweet smelling maple and boozy bourbon. Those are the only scents I'm getting. Not smelling any coffee really. -Tastes exactly as it smells. Strong maple and bourbon flavor but that's about it. Would be lying if I said I tasted coffee. Pure bourbon and maple flavor, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it feels pretty different from the original Sunday brunch. One thing worth noting though is that it doesn't taste as boozy as it smells. The alcohol is hidden very well. Would not have guessed it was 11%. -Mouth feel is near-perfect. Not as thick as I would have expected but surely far from watery. Perfect amount of carbonation. -Overall, I think this beer is absolutely delicious and deserves its highly acclaimed status. That being said, I would definitely like if there was a bit more coffee flavor to it, as that is one of my favorite aspects of the original Sunday brunch. Is it worth the price? Debatable. But its damn good and I would definitely recommend it to any porter/stout lover. 5/5. Jan 25, 2020 Report",

It’s hard to read) Consumed 4/12/20 I’ve been waiting to have this guy for awhile as Bomb is one of my first strong stouts that I’ve ever loved. Some other Prairie stouts can have too many adjuncts for me to really love, but I’m hoping BA Bomb hits the ride balance. First thing I notice is that it seems thinner than other Prairie stouts I’m used to. There’s very little carbonation too, even for a stout. I wonder if the age has something to do with that. Some lacing does stay though after the pour. On the nose I am not getting a lot of barrel but some spice like a regular bomb. I taste a bit of the pepper but not a lot. I think that’s usually what goes after aging. It’s sweet but not overly so. There’s barrel flavor too. Chocolate and vanilla notes a prominent. The beer is great but I wish I had it fresh. I think the aging has muted some of the best components of the beer. The barrel is perfect though. Great beer and worth seeking out! Apr 12, 2020 Report",4.46

T:  Taste is chocolate and coffee with some vanilla, oak, light chili heat, caramel, and roasted malts.  On the swallow there's more chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, vanilla, oak, and some slight lingering heat. M:  This beer has a fairly full and silky body.  Carbonation is nearly absent but it works for the beer while the finish is on the drying side from the ABV. O:  Overall this is a fantastic beer.  It has some great flavors and complexity which is heightened by the barrel aging.  Alcohol is also well hidden as this one   This is definitely a beer to be sipped and savored.

No bottling date visible.  Consumed 10/7/19. Beer poured black and with an aggressive pour a nice tan head materialized before dissipating quickly. Nose is light roasted malts and an ample amount of coffee, some vanilla, and a faint trace of bourbon. Taste is very well balanced between roasted malts, chilies, coffee, chocolate, and a kiss of bourbon.  Hopping and adjuncts are just to the right degree to offset the huge sweet malt base. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very smooth. Overall this was a fun splurge.   The bourbon and chili help balance the sweetness of the huge malt base very well.

The look is nice. Doesn't look like sludge which is remarkable considering the ingredients. Smooth looking, with a nice finger of khaki foam. Nose is actually incredible. Its like I'm smelling a fresh baked chocolate cupcake. The coconut is faint, the chocolate is dominant, the pastry aspect is present and they all work together quite brillaintly. Taste follows similarly. Anybody who nosed this knew this would be sweet. Chocolate is gracious, coconut adds that unique tropical or perhaps slight nutty element. The vanilla persists throughout. This is a pastry stout done right. Not overbearing, not sickening, just right. Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Dense and cloying. If sipped slowly this is an amazing 1 hour burn of a brew. Maybe an everything pretzel crisp or two for those who are wanting to cut some of the sweetness. This is a well done pastry stout. Like, really well done. But still, this is not for everybody. If you are not a fan of these, a contrast is probably in order. Perhaps a dark bread or a bit of sharp cheese. Or maybe as a digestif with friends after a particularly savory meal.

Deep, dark brown, body with ruby, cola highlights when backlit, sans bubbles: neither floating (after a wispy gathering of chestnut brown bubbles fails to gather), nor coating the glass, even with agitation. Chocolate fudge aroma wafts from the glass; released more with warmth. Subtle coconut and nutty aromas join and all flow seamlessly into the taste. Smooth, full feel is creamy yet a slight chalky residue, similar to cocoa powder remains and delays clearance of the palate to encourage another sip. An alcohol bitterness late in the swallow makes me unable to suspend my disbelief. It's not fusel, more like the lactose and vanilla influence. Overall, pleasant liquid dessert.

Served in a tulip. Pours a thick-and-viscous appearing motor oil black. A scant quarter-finger of coffee-colored suds lasts a half-minute or so, leaving a soft, creamy collar and a barely rousable oily, sugary film of super-slippery lacing. Nose is roasty-malty, nutty and mildly sweet. Aromas of fudge and dark roast coffee. Some nuttiness and woody, husky coconut as it warms. Taste is fudgy-sweet - but much less sweetness than anticipated. Tasting brown sugar chocolate vanilla fudge, molasses-sweetened coffee and - more prominently and notably as the beer warms - an earthy, woody nuttiness, ground bitter walnut, thick and heavy perfumy vanilla and husky coconut. Nice! Alcohol is hardly noticeable. Feel is smooth and viscous, dense but less thick and heavy than it appeared going into the glass! with super-fine, prickly carbonation making it feel a little lighter than it might otherwise. I want to say that it feels ‘sugary,’  like sugar water but that’s totally hallucinatory - it tastes like it should feel sugary but it does not. Abv is hardly evident. Overall, outstanding! I like to buy these sweet and sticky pastry stouts mainly so that I can complain about them and leave bad reviews but this was so damn good that I was wishing I hadn’t offered to share it with Boy and Spouse.

I used to call it my favorite beer. I haven't had any for years, but I recently picked up a 4-pack. I thoroughly disliked it this time. It's kind of gross. I don't know if the beer's changed, or if I've just become too accustomed to imperial IPAs and stouts and my tastes have changed drastically, but this is kind of bad. Horribly strong alcohol taste, overly carbonated, too dry of a finish, not really all that complex. Much of the complexity that might exist is drowned out by the alcohol.

Abt 12,"Reviewed by Whiteweasel from Ohio 4.22 /5 rDev -5.6% look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5 Aged for 15 years! The maximum recommended by the brewer, so it was time. Poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet. Probably somewhere in the vicinity of 60 F. A: Reddish amber goldenrod ombré in the glass, frothy persistent off-white head with heterogenous bubbles and slight lacing. 4 S: Yeasty and malty, with a raisin and plum character. Brings a little savory and herbal character along for the ride, almost reminiscent of marinara sauce. Some clove and medicinal herbs. Strong alcohol. 4 T: Heavy malt, with a rich savory character. Not a whole lot of nuance left. Raisin, stone fruit. Treacle and brown sugar. Very similar in character to aged ruby port. 4 M: Alcohol is very muted when cold, but then moves to the forefront. Smooth and pleasant in its texture. 4 Overall: The beer itself was nice, and I enjoyed it for what it was, but it was almost beside the point. This was the culmination of an “investment” I made before I had even reached my third decade, almost half a lifetime ago. An illicitly bought gift from my 19-year-old self who had no idea where or when this bottle would be enjoyed. It turned out this was to be in 2024, in my hometown where I had moved back to, enjoyed with a good friend, on an unseasonably warm (84 F) autumnal equinox. This bottle “watched” from the cellar as I graduated from college, lived in multiple countries on multiple continents, lost loved ones, got married, and bought a house. A great portion of a great life; perhaps the true beauty of the beer was this chance to reflect. It’s honestly hard to say what effect storing it for 15 years had, as I have never had the beer before and didn’t have a fresh version to compare with, but given how other beers have aged over even a year or two, this was a stellar beer that I have to give credit to for being well crafted. For this, it gets a 5 overall. Sep 22, 2024 Report",4.22

Gorgeous stuff, one of my favourite beers along with Rochefort 10. I prefer the latter, partly because it’s got the Trappist mystique placebo effect in my head, but I also feel the Bernardus has a slightly acrid after taste. I do however habitually drink it at a higher temperature than recommended, so that could be my fault. Still, pretty much the best beer that can be bought in a UK supermarket.

Who cares? They taste around the same to me. I never did a head to head comparison though. However the fact that it is easily obtained and relatively cheap make it better than Westy for me.

Abt 12,"Reviewed by Wheataleguy from Georgia 4.89 /5 rDev +9.4% look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75 Back to Belgium to try the St Bernardus 12 once again.  I lived in Germany for several years back in the day, very close to the Belgium border so I got really spoiled with so much great beer in that region.   This is one I've had there, and am now revisiting after a couple of decades.  I remember this one being a close relative of the famous Westvleteren 12, and tasting very similar.  The St Bernardus brewery brewed the Westvleteren's for the monastery under contract for awhile.  There may be a slight difference in the yeast used between the two, but to me the rest is very similar.  Both world class in my opinion.  So let's get on with this review.  Poured this one into a Belgian tulip glass, slowly into the center of the glass as it was upright on the counter.  No 45 degree stuff...straight, slow pour.  Save a bit in the bottle and give it a nice swirl in there to get that remaining yeast stirred and then pour it in.  As with all Belgian Trappists, a highly carbonated brew.  A three 1/2-finger off-white/caramel colored head and beautiful ruby-red dark color.  The head dissipates a bit quicker than say, the Rochefort.  Ended up with a nice one-finger tan head.  Wonderful carbonation though.  On the aroma...I cheated.  From the bottle, I got a good whiff of banana.  Surprised me because I don't remember this one having any such aroma.  From the glass, I get dark fruits.  Raison, dates, dark chocolate.  Just like I remembered, and it just makes you want to dive in.  On the taste, I get sweetness with a very mild bitterness, full bodied, very complex.  Right on cue with the style.  The carbonation drives those roasted malts straight into the palate where it stays for a while.  Lovely.  The dark fruits are there initially with a hint of dark chocolate and caramel, stays there for a bit and then on the backend some liquorish mixed in with the dark fruits, which is more pruny than raison on the backend. It's just very complex and delicious. The alcohol is felt on the way down, and as you continue to drink it, you'll begin to feel it on the way up too.  Especially after a Weihenstephaner Vitus.  There's a sharpness with the alcohol that I don't get when sipping on a Rochefort 10...you'll know you've got something with 10% ABV in your hand.  Since I drink for the flavor 90% of the time, I'd opt for the Rochefort 10 any day of the week when fancying a Belgian quad.  It's just not as smooth, and the mouthfeel is just a smudge less quality than some of the others.  Doesn't mean I'll never drink this one again.  You can never go wrong with any Belgian brew as far as I'm concerned.  There's a battle with Germany on who brews the best beer in the world, and they need to keep fighting and making beer even that much better.  Go get one of these St Bernardus 12 abbey brews.  It's not officially a ""Trappist"", but taste-wise you won't know the difference.  World Class still. Apr 06, 2024 Report",4.89

Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon.

Poured on draft at Trillium's Fenway location. Consumed and noted November 1st, 2021. Pours black with a finger of caramel khaki colored foam. Aroma is dense chocolate and coffee, leaning on both in a near even split. Caramel adds a touch of sweetness. Roasty and toasty malts add a firm foundation, and while tipping the beer into the 'heavy and dark' category, lands shy of being light-absorbing dark. Barrel, bourbon, and some light booze comes on at the end, but the nose still leans more firmly towards 'sweet'. Coffee is full, providing a whiff of wonderful medium-bodied roast. Flavor profile is BIG chocolate, followed quickly by coffee. It's akin to taking a bite out of a Hershey's chocolate bar, followed by a sip of Colombian origin coffee done through a Chemex. Roasty and toasty malts are layered underneath, establishing a dark and firm base, without impeding on the leading notes. Barrel, char, and bourbon add some light heat at the end without tipping the scale towards boozy. Whole flavor profile leans slightly towards 'sweet', but not enough so that it's a dessert beer. Mouth feel is a gorgeous thick, full, dense, and creamy texture. Overall, coffee is sublime here, and are accented well via milk chocolate and bourbon. While packing quite an array of notes, and a high alcohol content, this beer goes down slippery smooth. Draft. Reviewed from notes. Nov 13, 2021 Report",4.62

Sweet and fairly viscous, dark chocolate mocha liqueur and swirls of rum vanilla are delivered to the palate immediately and expressively. The barrel is quite present with a lightly woody maple bourbon warmth as a semi-sticky sting brings out some black pepper. I'm surprised how complex, deep and rich this is. Having this so much later than all their other collaboration stouts, it's no wonder they all carried so much hype behind them. This is clearly their best work in the barrel aged collaboration stout series, and being their first, they set the bar high. A bar that, IMO, they never hit again.

Extremely malted ale drenched with bourbon and red wine flavors, along with molasses, oak, and lots of vanilla. It’s thick and smooth, full bodied feel. Boozy. Molasses sweets balance the booze blend. After acquiring it more than a decade ago, I’m enjoying it today! The abv is manageable. Unique style ale that leans towards a strong stout at a sip or two.

Bourbon asserts next and licorice dances around as the bourbon and cocoa/coffee/bread synergize before the earthy notes signal that the party’s over and closes out with some ethanol Mouthfeel: Full, smooth, medium carbonation, and dry on the finish with ethanol coming through Overall: This is a deep and tasty Impy Stout. I’ve had this several times throughout the years, including the initial release back in ‘05/’06 but never reviewed it. It’s a well-made barrel aged Imperial Stout with a ton of depth that keeps unpacking more as it warms up. A great sipper and one of the better examples of the style, IMO.

A thin, tight bubble, dark tan colored head on the initial pour. Aromas of chocolate and a slight boozy smell. A delicous stout.  Numerous flavors hit you right away of bitter dark chocolate, coffee, deep roasted malts and a boozy bourban flavor.  A bitter and tangy aftertaste.  The ABV is noticeable but doesn’t overpower the flavor profile. Thick, creamy consistency with mild carbonation. A top-notch stout.  However, I’m not sure it deserves a 99/100 rating.

I’ve had the 2014 vintage for almost a year and forgot about it until I recently got the 2022 vintage from Tavour. That made me remember the 2014 and made me realize Cellaruary is the perfect time for this vertical tasting (which will leave me destroyed for the night after drinking all of this). I’ve never had any vintage of this beer before, but it should be interesting to see the difference 8 years makes in this beer. 2014: Pours completely pitch black with a finger of soapy light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing 2022: The exact same as the 2014, but leaves just a bit less lacing behind 2014: There’s a bit of a funk in the nose here, but I’m not complaining. I’m picking up on aromas of molasses, tannic red wine, cherry pit, cocoa powder, medium roast coffee, aged hops, sharp oak, smoky tobacco, and leather 2022: This one is way more hoppy and bitter as expected, but I can see how the aromas here can evolve into the funkier aromas in the older beer. I’m picking up on aromas of leafy hops, molasses, cacao nib, medium roast coffee, burnt sugar, orange marmalade, toasted oak, smoky tobacco, vanilla bean, and light caramel 2014: There’s less to it in taste unfortunately, but I still dig it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, burnt sugar, smooth oak, vanilla bean, licorice, smoky tobacco, cocoa powder, raisin, and light coffee. The swallow brings notes of cherry pit, molasses, aged hops, smoky tobacco, cacao nib, leather, raisin, and medium roast coffee 2022: Similarly here it just tastes like a watered down version of what the nose had promised, but again, still good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting leafy hops, burnt sugar, golden raisin, caramel, toasted oak, vanilla bean, light roast coffee, and cacao nib. The swallow brings notes of leafy hops, cacao nib, vanilla bean, cherry pit, burnt sugar, smoky tobacco, medium roast coffee, chicory, and light caramel 2014: A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and chewy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time 2022: A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and quite bitter It’s amazing how different these beers are yet are scored nearly the same. They’re both damn good in their own ways.

With an ABV of over 11%, this beer does not come off as overly boozy, despite its aging in bourbon and French oak barrels. Finally, there is a finish of sarsaparilla and milky molasses.

Rather, it is a dry, dark and burnt character leaning towards tart/bitter end of the scale for me.  It is like a dry RIS.  I like it.  More of the bitter Chocolate and Coffee end of the spectrum.  It is mellow, and not boozy (for me).  Mouth feel is medium, and not too chewy.  Just right actually.  Looks like motor oil from an old V8 that has not been drained in 20k miles.

The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer. Apr 24, 2021 Report",

Leche Borracho,"Reviewed by WesMantooth from Ohio 4.45 /5 rDev -0.9% look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5 A 2018 release packaged in a 500ml bottle. While filling the teku halfway, it is a viscous stout that produces a fairly frothy, brown head that not only has great retention, it never disappears. There is a constant film on top that tapers up to a thicker, cap sized ring around the glass. First thing I can smell is definitely cinnamon. Tequila is also noticeable. To me it seems more like a white tequila because I tend to think it gives off more gin like floral notes. Otherwise there is a hint of a sriracha like pepper sauce, and chocolate. Wow. The flavors really pop. A bit of tequila (aged this time) up front followed by chili peppers that deliver way more flavor than heat, but just enough bite to offset the sweetness and play off the, by far most dominant, flavor of cinnamon that is there throughout. It rounds off into a cocoa powder like chocolate with a touch of smokiness and lingering baking spice. As it warms, there is some vanilla in the finish too. Very nice combination of flavors. My only knock would be the sweetness starting to creep up the ladder as I make my way through it. The body stands out the most. Which was the case for the very first beer I ever had of theirs. I said at the time that they were in the league of Bourbon County and Firestone Walker. Lush, velvety, and significant, yet so easy to drink. There is some tingling from the peppers. Personally, I think that a touch more heat would put this right there, if not ahead of Mexican Cake for the best spiced stout I have had, but it is definitely at a level that it should appeal to everyone.

Abraxas,"Reviewed by taxandbeerguy from Canada (ON) 4.55 /5 rDev +1.8% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75 750ml bottle from a US visit. Served cool into a long-stemmed trappist glass. Listed at 10.5% ABV. Been waiting a while to cross this one off my list. Appearance - Slick and oily looking from the glass, pitch black with a finger plus of short lived deep tan head with a nice hiss. Leaves a tiny soapy collar and no lacing. Smell - Cinnamon is the biggest star, with a healthy amount of dark chocolate and vanilla to back things up. Maybe it's the combo with the chilis, but the cinnamon really pops in the most pleasant of ways. Taste - Sort of sweet with the chocolate leading up front, vanilla mixed in and plenty of cinnamon. Becomes more bitter with some darker chocolate, a touch of earthiness and the peppers start to kick in. Then afterwards the chilis continue to prickle which is enhanced by the cinnamon. Maybe even a hint of smoke in the aftertaste. A flavor profile that will stay with you for a while. Mouthfeel - Full bodied and with low carbonation, but luscious and velvety with the prickliness from the peppers once and then again the peppers come for round two with the cinnamon riding shotgun. Overall - I've enjoyed my fair share of the Mexican style Imperial Stouts in my time, but Abraxas, just seems to delve a little deeper than most of the competition (which are excellent stouts in their own rights), with the linger chilis and the prevalence but not overuse of cinnamon coming through in such a pronounced manner. Awesome beer that should be enjoyed at cellar (but not fridge) temperature and completely worth the arm and leg of financial cost needed to obtain it. For a special sipper, it's worth it.

Abraxas,"Reviewed by Snowcrash000 from Germany 3.94 /5 rDev -11.9% look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4 Pours an opaque, pitch-black coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas, with hints of vanilla coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with a poor balance of roasted, caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes, with the cinnamon standing out particularly, as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation. BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. Also, the ABV is very well-hidden, this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. This is by no means a bad beer, just feels more like a Pastry Stout than a Mexican Stout to me.

Taking a first sip, the cacao really pops. A light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows. The chili isn't spicy, but it's flavorful. This is a fantastic imperial stout. At first, I thought this might be a little too sweet, but as I drink more, it's really not. The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it. I might have dialed it back just a hair, but that's a nitpick. FULL bodied. Nice and thick, like an imperial stout should be. Almost chewy. As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable. Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. Wonderful. Overall, this is one of the very best imperial stouts I've had. Excellent job. I will buy a few more of these and see how they age, assuming I can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first. Jun 30, 2023 Report",4.53

Beer is part of a BIF winnings from the NFL BIF 33, I think. Beer was received last fall (2021) and has been in my cellar till today.  I think it is a 2019 vintage. The beer pours a jet black color with a fluffy tan head foaming up 2 cm even with a gentle pour.  This foam slowly fades to a sturdy edge layer after the pour. Aroma on this brew is rich dark chocolate, fudge brownie, cinnamon notes and some earthy slightly spicy pepper notes. No hint of hops nor the ABV of this beer. First sip from the glass reveals a medium body with fine tingly carbonation and a silky texture.  The mouthfeel is a little less full than I expected, but this seems a nice stout on physical traits. Flavor is roasted malts, dark chocolate,  and fudge.  I then get some cinnamon and peppery notes, with very mild tingly warmth buried in the background. This warmth does show up again on the burps on the beer. I never get any hint of the ABV and hops are absent on flavor profile too.

Mack's Beverage in Parma, Ohio. Well yes, the place was very cool and had a lot to choose from. But i was really surprised to see multiple vintages of Abraxas on the shelf. The different years were different prices so i just bought the oldest and most expensive one which was a 2020. $25. Worth a try. Poured into a snifter and man that head just disappeared as soon as i poured it. Color was dark brown. The smell is sweet like cocoa and coffee, with a tinge of spiciness to it that tingles the nose a bit. Taste is rich and velvety, warm smooth melting chocolate and a slight bitterness of coffee. Yes the cinnamon is also there enriching the experience. I'm looking for more chili pepper in the beer. It's slight but not nearly strong enough to get my top marks. I like it when the beer bites back. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and full, bubbling only the slightest bit. Another reviewer compared this to Christmas Bomb and Xocoveza, and having had both those beers, I would say this rates pretty highly up there with both of those brews. Overall this is an awesome beer, and definitely one of the better stouts i've tried.

Abraxas,"Reviewed by Historiker from Ohio 5 /5 rDev +11.9% look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5 If you're a fan of Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, then congrats - you're already a fan of Abraxas. A pretty leisurely pour into an imperial pint glass produced a thick, beautiful 4 inch tan head. The head itself appeared slowly and almost dramatically, and only after I'd stopped pouring. It breaks down slowly, forming a 1/2"" cap with fantastic lacing. Smelled of molasses, cinnamon, cacao, and chilies. This is a beautiful aroma, very reminiscent of Christmas Bomb/Xocoveza, but smoother and more refined. Taste followed the nose, but with pronounced maltiness that really ties the whole thing together. Too often, winter releases use cinnamon either to conceal deficiencies or act as second fiddle to sugar or honey.  Abraxas employs the chilies and cinnamon to great effect, creating a flavor profile that perfectly compliments the vanilla and cacao. The chilies aren't there to be spicy, but to enhance the flavor. To drink this brew is to drink mastery in action. The mouthfeel of this beer is complex. Drink it before the head dissipates, and you have a milkshake. Drink it after the head reduces down to a 1/2"" cap, and you have a thick, viscous, syrupy, yet smooth delight. Very light carbonation. I paid around $25 for a 750ml bottle, and it was worth every penny. This is perfect for a Christmas get together, or just a cold winter night. Most definitely in the same family as Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, but Abraxas is in a class of its own - definitely the elder statesman of the group. Buy it, and be prepared to be amazed.

It was one that really stood out and I enjoyed them all.  Had it a few months after that because I found it at my favorite beer shop(the only place I know that almost exclusively sells nothing but beer and a small selection of liquor).  It was just as good as the first time.  The only beer I've had that's similar in taste to this is Firestone-Walker's Mole Merkin.  There's a ton of flavor in this beer but they all mix together quite wonderfully.  This is one of my favorite beers, I'm big on stouts and this one is up there with the best of em .  Update for 2021-2022 version, it was as good as the first time I've tried it.  One of my all time favorite beers, I can't recommended it enough!  If anyone sees it out in the wild definitely pick it up because it can be quiet hard to come by, even for locals. Oct 29, 2021 Report",4.84

Pours a thick motor oil black with a tan head that springs up once you stop pouring. The brew has a beautiful tan colored coating around the glass when swirled. It smells like molasses, chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, and hints of toffee. The taste is truly incredible. At lower temperatures the chocolate and alcoholic sweetness take the center stage with vanilla extract like aftertaste. The flavor gets better as it warms and almost taste likes a dark chocolate cinnamon roll. It's very very thick and completely coats the mouth, but it's slightly carbonated and much more refreshing than anyone could ever expect. It goes down illegally smoothly for a 12% beer. Overall very very good, don't pass this up if you have a chance to grab it on tap. Jul 12, 2021 Report",4.71

Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Portsmouth tulip. Seal brown liquid with a faint ecru collar. Vague lacing; no retention; thick sheen of tears cascades down the sides. Cocoa, treacle, stewed plums and currant jam, along with faint tobacco and milk chocolate notes in the nose. Lavish and inviting. Some alcohol around the edges, but nothing fusel. Intense chocolate notes permeate the flavor profile, although the malt base has some definite complexity with a range of toast/char/chocolate notes. Bitterness is balanced between clean earthy hops and cocoa. Some warmth and spice from the ancho, while the spices emerge in the finish with a light dusting of cinnamon and the vanilla almost suggesting some time in a barrel. Rich, deep, but the adjuncts threaten to overwhelm the base beer. Medium, earthy finish. Creamy, smooth, full-bodied, sticky mouth-feel. Light but sufficient carbonation. Outstanding, well balanced, bittersweet, and potent. Jul 10, 2021 Report",4.44

It seemed fitting to serve the beer in an Olympia Goblet at a temperature of 48 degrees. The pour created a creamy, foamy, half-fingered light tan head with poor retention. I wasn't expecting much retention, given the beer's age and high ABV. What I saw was sufficient. The beer's color is a dark, rusty brown, charting at SRM 26, and is semi-opaque. The appearance of the beer is above average. Nosing the beer, I detect notes of chocolate, cherries, bananas, raisins, cloves, bourbon, char, wood, and phenols. Smelling the beer again, I notice caramel, molasses, toffee, dark roasted malts, bread, malty sweetness, a hint of fire, coffee, and earthiness. The first sip revealed notes of chocolate, bananas, wood, vanilla, medium-roasted coffee, caramel, and char, finishing with a hint of bourbon. Sipping the beer again, I taste bread, cloves, phenols, floral esters, molasses, cherries, dark-roasted malts, malty sweetness, earthiness, and leather. The mouthfeel is coating and chewy, finishing a bit warm. The body is medium-plus and has a hint of carbonation. Final Thought: This nine-year-old beer is a stunning example of why I got into beer. The beer does show some age; however, the aging is elegantly refined. The beer has plenty of carbonation, and the ABV is well-balanced, making it a delightful and delicious treat after a busy day at work. Jul 29, 2025 Report",4.59

Presented flat. No foam at all. Deep brown, borders on black. Smells great. Dark stone fruits and that famiiar Quad on the nose. Taste is toes on the line too sweet, but it doesn’t become cloying or teeth-achingly so. I think maybe because it’s 7 years old, some if the nuances intended have been lost. But the dark brown sugar, stewed plums and oak  barrel all make appearances throughout the chew. Feel is very dense, quite viscous, no carbonation.

Stickee Monkee,"Reviewed by tide from California 4.22 /5 rDev -5.6% look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25 The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale. The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy. Sep 18, 2022 Report",4.22

The beer has been in its box in my cellar since I purchased it. The beer pours a dark mahogany color with some ruby highlights when I hold my glass to the light. A fizzy and short-lived beige head of 1 cm foams up and fades to nothing after the first few sips of the beer. the aroma on this is rich and malty with dark chocolate, toffee, prunes, raisins, and plums mixing with a bit of red grape and maybe some port wine character.  No hop presence on the nose, with only a little bit of fusol alcohol notes to remind me of the 12% ABV. First sip reveals a medium body with sticky mouthfeel and fine tingly carbonation.  The beer is a bit of a sipper due to ABV, but the stickiness coats my palate and lips and slows my consumption as well. Flavor is again all malt with toffee, prune and raisin with more brown sugar and molasses than I got on the nose. I also get  a little bourbon, but again the hops are absent here. Booze comes through on the finish with some warming down my throat on the swallow. This is a sipping beer and I really enjoy the complexity and texture.  The dark color makes me think this could easily be in the old ale category as well and the ABV makes this take almost all night to finish my glass, but as I stated, I enjoy this one a lot and find the complexity enjoyable.

Barleywine brown with hardly any bubbles. Rich caramel and toffee on the nose with noticeable but incredible alcohol sting to it. Tastes follows. Pretty intense but a highly enjoyable sipper.  The mouthfeel is medium-full leaning towards the thinner side but kind of allows for some drinkability given the high abv on this thing. Overall, a wonderful brew. One I honestly thought I would never try so was thrilled on the chance to do so and loved the aromas and flavors. Hints at port wine but overall drinks like a beer. Really good stuff.

Poured from a small 2ish oz bottle into a Bier Brewing tasting glass. The beer pours an amber/brown color with no head and no lacing to speak of. The aroma is Boozy with caramel and brown sugar notes. as the beer warms you can detect notes of dark fruits, but the dominant aroma is similar to a nice bourbon. The flavor is similar to the nose... boozy with maple syrup and caramel notes. Caramel and burnt sugar notes, as the beer warms I get raisin and cherry notes. The beer is completely still and finishes dry Overall, this beer definitely leans more into the spirit category than beer. Dry and boozy with complex flavors, this would definitely be worth the price of admission if it were more readily availible. Apr 06, 2025 Report",4.52

Distinctly smokey (tending toward peat) and oaky with raisins. No yeast, no hops. Flavor – 4.75 – Begins hot and sweet.  No yeast, no hops. Complex alcohols, much more than just ethanol (28 % ABV, according to the website). The tannins from the barrels don’t impact the flavor as much as the vanillin.  Peatiness is very mellow, compared to the nose.  Golden raisins.  No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.  Marked palate and gastric warming. Palate – 4.5 – Full: slightly syrupy: virtually no carbonation.

Part of the Imperial Stout and Barleywine BIF#2 and the chaos that it entails.  This beer is a 2023 vintage. The beer pours a murky brown to chestnut color.  Absolutely no head even with an extremely aggressive pour. I do get some legs on the glass like a merlot or liquor. Aroma is hot! Definitely fusol notes and some mild brown malt note and burnt sugar, but brown liquor is dominant and hot. I think a little port wine note here too. No hop character here. First sip reveals a medium to lighter body with sticky texture and no carbonation. Flavor is intense on this one.  I get some brown sugar and butterscotch with a little strong black pepper and fusol bite.  Solid warming on the swallow. Definitely sweeter bourbon notes mixed into this one also.  I keep coming back to butterscotch or like a werthers on the flavor after I swallow each sip. Never any hop character. No doubt this is a sipping ""beer"". I use quotes as this is much more a liquor experience than beer.  I am happy to have tried this under reviewable conditions and enjoy what I have, but dont believe I would buy a full bottle of this beer at the price. Apr 05, 2025 Report",4.19

Raisins, vanilla, bourbon, and port also come through. Wow, just wow. The taste is super intense. Holy crap. So much going on, with a slight burn on the way down. Tons of brandy, raisins, cherries, burnt toffee, caramelized sugar, slightly nutty, and a hint of truffle. Fantastic, and a sample that I wish wouldn't end.

S - Alcohol is pretty powerful and in your face, but there is also big aroma of dark dried fruit,  Think fig, raisins, dates. etc... Like a strong English Barleywine or a good German Dopplebock. T- There is definitely some heat from the high ABV, but there is also that delicious dark dried fruit taste with dare I say a bit of cacao? Reminded me a bit of the Chunky candy bar. MF - The mouthfeel is rather thin and a little oily. That being said, it coats the mouth well and the high AVB lets it linger for awhile. Overall Utopia is a definite splurge. If you have a Beer Geek friend or 2 and can afford it, it's definitely worth checking out at least once in your life.  Is it wildly overpriced, yes, is it mind blowing, no.

I’m more than a bit thrifty but I wanted to try this legendary brew. I ordered proper glassware to serve this ‘“beer”. Poured into a Glencairn whiskey glass, the headless, reddish liquid was a perfect match of the mahogany trim on my Stressless recliner. Aroma, I can’t imagine anything prettier, it would make a great perfume: bourbon, sherry, wine, caramel, maple & an abundance of barrel aromas. Flavor: far more complex flavors than my meeker palate can discern but here are few I can pick out, bourbon, wine, caramel, ripe fruit, vanilla with maple & tart cherries at the finish.  There is no carbonation but plenty of alcohol, this definitely a sipper. It is delicious & it’s aroma is heavenly. Is it worth the high price?  Probably not. Will I try another in future?

Sam Adams Utopias. Me and my buddy Pru managed to find a bottle about 2 hours from home because we just couldn’t wait for this year’s release. This is also beer #800 for me! I’m very excited to break into this, so I’m gonna stop wasting time and open it up Obviously this is not a beautiful pour for beer, but the presentation of the bottle alone is worth a 5. Pours clear dark amber with no head but nice legs It’s very evident that this was brewed with maple syrup, as the nose is a mapley booze bomb. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy bourbon, sticky maple, cinnamon, sweet vanilla, rum raisin, smooth oak, dark cherry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and a touch of honey This is super sweet in taste, somewhere in between a barleywine and a bourbon or cognac. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting strong maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, dried plum, and burnt sugar. The swallow has a pretty decent burn and brings notes of sweet maple syrup, black cherry, spicy bourbon, buttery oak, brown sugar, creamy vanilla, dried plum, sherry, fig, and a touch of cocoa A medium full body with almost no carbonation, just an alcoholic tingle resulting in a rich beer. Finishes somewhat dry but quite sweet This is not necessarily an amazing beer, and not even necessarily a beer. However, it’s really a once in a lifetime experience, and I am thoroughly enjoying it.

This beer looks thick as heck while pouring. It's a red/brown color coming from the bottle. There's no head at all, which doesn't surprise me one bit, based on the age and ABV. The nose is out of this world. In a way, to me, it smells like a fine bourbon. Very boozy, first off. I get tons of caramel, toffee, chocolate, raisin, plum, and so much more that I can't fully describe. This is an outstanding aroma. Taste - I know I won't do justice to this - Chocolate is up front, as is the raisin and plum. It then goes to the back to toffee and caramel. I'm also getting vanilla in the mix. This is really only a small portion of the flavors I'm getting overall,  but I just can't put words to them. Body - Up front there's a bit of a burn from the alcohol, but WAY less than the ABV would suggest. It then turns to a smooth, almost creamy feeling, that is so smooth and easy drinking.

Blend 7, August 2022. Bought it at Bottlecraft about a year and a half ago. Pours clear peach-orange, not much head by the time it got to me, looks still. Smell is musty, dried peach pits, eventually releases a bright stonefruit juiciness. Tart. Taste is on the tart fruit leather side, very acidic and vinegary, overwhelming the fruitiness a bit.

For dating, label includes the details of 'BLEND SEVEN AUGUST 2022'. Cloudy, apricot orange colored body. No real lasting head. No lacing. Aroma of apricot, oak, and rich funk of expresses horse blanket, leather, and hay. Taste is initially quite woody and herb bud like, and then the sweet/sour apricot comes in. Notes of lemon wash through, along with the dry oak. Late is white wine. The funk is very much of grass and hay. After taste does not last very long, but the essence of apricot lingers. Tart and drying mouth feel. The teeth are scraped clean with each sip. Quiet carbonation. The apricot expresses so naturally here, and is the longest lasting flavor note. The herb, oak, funk, and lemon are worthy subordinates. Aug 04, 2023 Report",4.45

Aurelian Lure,"Reviewed by BEERchitect from Kentucky 4.26 /5 rDev -4.9% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25 Brewed with apricots, spontaneously fermented and allowed to ripen to full sour ale maturity, you'd think that this time honored way of beer making is rooted in the belly of Brussels. But nope, it's Austin Texas. Aurelian Lure is the lambic-like brainchild of Jester King, pouring with a pale and deep lemon yellow with a light golden center. As the yeasty ale rises with a dainty champagne froth, the jaw-tightening scent of citrus, vinous and stone fruit carry the piquant tang of cider, dusty funk and extended oak aged white wine. As a scantly sweet taste briefly visit the tongue, early impressions of wafers, honey and sourdough offer a slim malt impact. A quick wash of acidity across the middle palate shows a quick erase of anything malty and an ushering in of sour apricot that stand proud above the other fruity complements of weathered lemon, grapefruit, lime and yuzu. Dried pineapple, peach and white grape all continue to grow from the natural fermentae of the sour ale and play into a strikingly sour late palate of off-vinegar, mature and peppery acids that pang away on the sides of the tongue. Light, crisp, succinct and highly refreshing, the session is sweat inducing and tooth achingly sour to satisfy the taste for unblended lambic in the deep south. As an afterglow of weathered woods, wine rot and an overall mossy type of earthiness come in brief waves, the aftertaste is otherwise short and concisely winey. May 16, 2023 Report",4.26

Smell blasts you with sour apricot backed by complex oak, orange and farmhouse yeast.  Taste is a cover up of the scandal.  The scandal you ask?  The apricot is wickedly acidic and pretty sour too, this is then covered up by farmhouse yeast, light barrel funk, lemon, and oak, but for that moment when the scandal was alone on the palate it was rough.  Very bright and sour, funk is not impactful here, oak is brightly so, acidity builds as the secret wants to get out.  I love JK but this is the #15 wild ale in the world?

Aurelian Lure,"Reviewed by JohnG190 from New York 4.46 /5 rDev -0.4% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Pours a hazy golden color with a thin head that dissipates immediately. The aroma is immediately noticeable, with a strong scent of apricots and a subtle hint of oak. Upon tasting, the apricot flavor dominates, with a tartness that is balanced by a slight sweetness. The oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity, imparting a mild vanilla flavor that complements the fruitiness of the apricots. The beer finishes with a refreshing tartness that lingers on the tongue, leaving a dry finish. One of the standout features of Aurelian Lure is its balance. Despite being a sour ale, the tartness is not overwhelming, and is instead complemented by the sweetness of the apricots and the subtle oak notes. This makes for a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a flavor profile that is likely to appeal to both seasoned sour beer enthusiasts and those new to the style. Another noteworthy aspect of Aurelian Lure is its mouthfeel. The beer is medium-bodied with a light carbonation, which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. The combination of tartness and effervescence make this a perfect summer beer, though it's enjoyable year-round. Overall, Jester King Brewery's Aurelian Lure is a fantastic sour ale that showcases the brewery's expertise in wild yeast and spontaneous fermentation. It's a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a balanced flavor profile and a refreshing mouthfeel. While it may be difficult to find due to its limited availability, it's certainly worth seeking out for any beer enthusiast looking to try something truly special. Mar 26, 2023 Report",4.46

The tartness and acidity comes in on the backend, and is somewhat lighter than I expected.  Really superb. Soft, mildly creamy mouthfeel with tight carbonation.

Aurelian Lure,"Reviewed by Vidblain from Minnesota 4.5 /5 rDev +0.4% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Blend 4. I'm continually amazed by how much fruit falls off of sours when aged for some time. I recently enjoyed a Fen Tao and the peach notes were tremendous. Since then, I've drank a Nocturn Chrysalis and an Aurelian Lure - neither have had a comparable presence of fruit, after two years of aging. I'm surprised, for some reason. All beers age differently, but it seems consistent that fruit notes fall off a bit. Aurelian Lure thus doesn't have much apricot presence left. It's dominated now by sour, tart barrel notes. It's also very acidic. Damn sour, damn tart, and very good - but my acidic reflux was unpleasant after this beer. Be prepared accordingly. Sep 17, 2018 Report",

Pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring.  Aroma is excellent.  A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass.  Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat. On the tongue, the funk is much more present.  The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk.  Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are.  On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel.  Surprisingly full body.  Well carbonated and smooth, despite a bit of acidity. Overall, this is an excellent beer.  Complex and layered in a way I don't often see.  The barrels really add to the experience.

Juicy,"Reviewed by SierraNevallagash from Maine 4.61 /5 rDev +2.9% look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Alan, thank you so much for this one. 2019 vintage - 375ml bottle - poured into a Zinfandel stem at 45°F. With a loud, forceful *POP* of the cap, Juicy pours a slightly foggy deep burnish orange-amber hue - rather dark, forming just a razor-thin collar with some slow lazy rising bubbles. Nose: My goodness, this is striking. This is a mandarin orange - freshly peeled and squeezed until the juice begins to run. Not naval, not Cara Cara, not mineola - mandarin - joined by gooseberry, white grape, Meyer lemon, apricot, gingerbeer, green apple, cloudberry jam, all swirling amidst some subtle barnyard funk, wet hay, petrichor, cellar stone, wet leaves, wine-soaked oak, old books, some zesty acidity, and these immensely complex perfume notes. This may be the single most impressive aroma I've encountered. My first ever 5 on anything. I don't hand those out... Palate: Juicy greets the palate with that soft, restrained Hill Farmstead tartness - citrusy - with a noticeable malt sweetness behind it. There's almost some IPA influence, with juicy flavours of grapefruit, pineapple, fresh grass, gooseberry, white grape, and some serious sauvignon blanc influence. Mid-way, the subtle acidity fades, revealing some grainy malt, and a musty, overripe dankness emerges. The brighter fruity notes begin to give in to some grassy character, orange pith, lime leaf, and some bitter peach pit. Some resinous Nelson hop character emerges, still bacled by some lemon zest, and then vinous wine cask, tannic grape skin, and lightly bitter hop resinous waft through the finish. Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-bodied, with a touch of weight to it, despite its small size. Effervescence is ultra-fine - on par with champagne, but much, much softer. Some dry tartness up front, fading to semi-dry with grain poking through, and then finishing mostly dry, with some tannins and resinous hop oil cling. Overall: This is a truly spectacular example of what creativity, nuance, and new boundaries can achieve. This farmhouse ale displays a rare quality of not really having an equal - as in, nothing really compares to it. It's a saison, but it has some pale ale spirit, but it Nelson-hopped, with theae heady, exotic elements that pair seamlessly and beautifully with the wine barrel, and everything about it is so perfectly rounded and softened, like a river rock smoothed by the waters of time. One of those rare, inspiring bottles that just sings in harmony. Jan 22, 2021 Report",4.61

I have purchased several beers from Bottle Logic since then. I am serving the beer at 50 degrees in a tulip glass. The pour created an airy, one-fingered, dark tan head with average retention. The slow dissipation left no lacing on the glass, only a dark tan ring around the liquid. The color is pitch black with a mahogany-red hue and is semi-transparent, charting at 36. This beer's appearance is average; I would have liked to see a longer-lasting head, but it is understandable because of the ABV. Nosing the glass, I smelled black strap, anise, bourbon, oak, char, leather, floral, raisins, dark brown sugar, earthiness, dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, spicy rye, black pepper, dark roasted malts, malty sweetness, and toffee. Sipping the beer, I taste dark chocolate, espresso, bourbon, black strap, char, Maillard, leather, wood resin, treacle, caramel, toffee, oak, floral esters, spicy rye, dark toasted bread crust, malty sweetness, anise, and grassy. The mouthfeel is slightly astringent, finishing smooth with some dryness. The body is heavy and has medium-low carbonation. Darkstar November is a perfect example of why I love Russian Imperial Stouts; the beer is crammed with flavor and balance. The hop profile is aggressive but not off-putting. The deep, rich malt profile and the barrel aging added depth and character to a complex beer. The molasses is akin to a black strap without the bitter sulfur. I love the rye complexity; it adds another layer to this intricate beer.  Fantastic beer! Apr 25, 2025 Report",4.78

This seems to have gone through some evolution but still the molasses and bourbon barrel aging (not Buffalo Trace). Also I don't see why this is not an American Imperial, but maybe that was added in later years. Pours a dark brown, near black with a lack of foam in the chalice. Appealing boozy smell. Mouthfeel is unctuous with plenty of spritz still dissolved. This does seem like the most alcohol tasting beer I can remember, at 14.76 percent. The flavor is all heat and darkness and sugar. Quite interesting and smooth, but certainly sugary beyond any expectation in a beer. Helps it last, I guess. I don't notice any rye flavor or very much bitterness, but it's a big sweet stout without any silly flavoring. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at O'shea Brewing. Feb 28, 2025 Report",

Taste is sweet and roasty with notes of rye, molasses, dark fruit, and an assertive bourbon barrel presence.

The beer pours a very dark black color and is fairly thick in appearance out of the bottle. Dark tan head foams up about 1 cm in my glass and fades to a very thin edge layer fairly soon after the pour.  Beer looks like an imperial stout in the glass. Aroma on this big beer is dark fudge and some brown sugar mixing with quite a bit of bourbon.  No hop presence and the booziness is hidden on the nose also. First sip reveals a fairly thick body and sticky texture. This beer feels like a big boozy one.  Carbonation is fine and fairly mild, but the beer does coat my palate on each sip. Flavor is similar to the nose, brown sugar and molasses mixes with dark cacao chocolate and a good dose of bourbon. Here there is some bitey booze on the finish and just a little warmth also. I do get some dark fruit on the burps of this beer, raisin shows up there. No hop character on flavor. This is quite the big imperial stout and I am feeling it well before my glass empties.

Bottle Logic Stouts have been impressing me recently as well so I figured this one was worth a shot. Let’s pop it open and find out if it’s any good Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of dreamy dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing The molasses is very forward in the nose, odd since I was expecting the rye to dominate but I can’t complain. I’m picking up on aromas of blackstrap molasses, chocolate fudge, sweet whiskey, vanilla bean, rye bread, earthy cinnamon, light raisin, and a touch of tonka bean It’s more balanced in taste but the molasses is still super loud. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting toasted oak, sweet whiskey, rye spice, molasses, brown sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla bean, and light rasin. The swallow brings notes of blackstrap molasses, brown sugar, rye bread, maple syrup, vanilla bean, cocoa powder, tobacco, sweet whiskey, and raisin A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer.

I am using a chalice and serving at a serving temperature of 48 degrees. The pour created a frothy, creamy, one-fingered head with excellent retention—the somewhat slow dissipation left thick lacing on the glass. The color is brown with a ruby garnet hue, charting at SRM 26, and semi-opaque. The overall appearance of the beer is above average. Nosing the beer, I detect notes of stone fruit, cherries, toasted malty sweetness, chocolate, caramelized sugar, raisins, plums, banana, toasted bread crust, white pepper, cloves, yeasty phenols, and some earthiness. The beer smells delicious. Sipping the beer, I immediately get toasted bread, malty sweetness, bananas, white pepper, cloves, yeasty phenols, plums, caramelized sugar, chocolate, light coffee, cherries, and a light nuttiness. The mouthfeel is soft, finishing smooth. The body is medium, with medium-high carbonation. Final Thought: I am not judging this beer by the hype; however, the publicity behind Westvleteren beers is warranted. The best Dubbel beer that I have ever tried. The flavors are spot on, adhering to the style guidelines. I wish I had several more of these beers to sip on. Aug 27, 2025 Report",4.74

A bottle of its own distinct design. No label but blue cap where I can see that this is a Westvleteren 8. Pours very dark brown with big off-white head. Settles as 3 cm thick blanket of fluffy foam. Substantial lacing. Aroma is a little subdued due to the massive amount of foam. But it gets stronger as the beer warms up. Aroma is sweetish with caramel, sugar, lightly roasted malts, humid cellar and damp old newspapers. Medium carbonation. Medium thick texture. Flavor is (only) medium sweet. Followed by a quite strong bitterness with an acidic hint. Aftertaste is bitter. Lingering. Always hard to form an opinion on such a celebrity beer.

The brewery recommends drinking within 3 years of bottling so his means the beer was bottled on or about  November 22, 2023.  I purchased this as part of a mixed six pack from Westvleterenshop.com for USD $203.51, beer $139.00, shipping $52.99, tax $11.52.  I purchased on 6-19-24 and received just eight days later in the mail on June 27, 2024. APPEARANCE:  pours a dark brown color with one-finger tan head that slowly dissipated until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, heavy lacing on the glass, medium carbonation. SMELL:  the nose is spectacular, cola, bread, dark fruits like fig and raisin, very complex. TASTE:  the taste follows  the nose, initially bread and sweet cola then dark fruits like raisin and fig, the taste really lingers on the palate in a most positive way, the 8% alcohol is completely disguised. PALATE:  medium carbonation but full bodied. OVERALL:  I liked this better than Westvleteren 12, the alleged ""best beer in the world"", for Dubbel I still prefer Chimay, this is probably the second best Dubbel I have had, I don't know if I'll ever go to to Belgium but if I do will be sure to purchase this again, it's not worth what I paid but it's just money and cheaper than flying to Belgium, that's what I'm telling myself :) Jun 30, 2024 Report",

Pour produced a buff head. Beer is an even walnut brown, cloudy, with amber highlights. Takes on a reddish tone towards the end as more light gets through. Nose is rye bread, cola, raisins, plums, allspice. Understated, balanced. No bananas or yeasty funk. Dates and alcohol emerge during drinking. More esters escape as you drink as well, making this beer peak near the halfway point. Taste is the real strong suit. Pumpernickel and mineral water base under demerera sugar, clove, and licorice. Alcohol comes forward on taste during drinking as it did on the nose. Also like the nose, the overall effect is of balance and restraint. Feel is full and crisp. Soda-like carbonation carries a weighty brew over the tongue. Overall, a fine brew. May 01, 2024 Report",4.75

Pours a lightly hazy, medium to dark brownish orange with a fizzy, one finger khaki head that dissipates to patches with light lacing; a bit of particulates at the bottom of the glass despite a calm pour..Aroma of dry caramel malt, figs, raisins, dates and and some toffee. Flavor follows, with deep caramel malt, dried dark fruit, particularly dates and raisins, brown bread and cloves. Finishes a bit minierally but with residual dark fruit. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Has a much brighter flavor profile than any dubbel I've had before, almost a Belgian dark ale flavor. This is undoubtedly due to this having a bit of age to it with a best buy date of 2019, so likely about 8 years old. Probably my only chance to try this, so I grabbed a bottle. Despite the assumed lighter characater for aging, has a deep malt and great fruit notes. A slight sharpness (mineral) in the finish, but the residual fruit flavors make up for it. This makes me really want to try a fresher bottle, but I'm still impressed with the malty flavor depth of the 8; not quite a deep and malty as 12, but fine. A rare treat, I've wanted to try something from this brewery since I started my interest in craft beers and glad to try the dubbel and quad. Mar 24, 2023 Report",

The feel was excellent, the massive head didn’t dissipate the carbonation that I could tell and somehow that is what made it all work together.

A little protein build up floats in the glass. The first 3/4 of the bottle was poured into the glass for this review, with more sediment in the final quarter. Head is three fingers of off-white foam, which retains well. Aroma is sticky caramel, toffee, raisins, and bread pudding. A little yeast spice counters the initial sugary notes, with bready, caramely, light earthy malts firming up the whole thing. Clove adds a bit of herbal bite to the mid-section. Flavor profile is raisins, toffee, molasses, cinnamon, and almonds. Spicy yeast esters work well with bready, caramely, earthy malts to balance out the initial sugary notes, without smothering them out. In total, it has a hearty bread pudding taste without being over zealous in sweetness. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft, expansive effervescence that seems to feel bigger at the end than the start. This effect helps create a comforting, full feeling. Overall, some great malt and flavor undertones in both nose and taste. A comfortable blanket of a beer. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 33cl bottle. Apr 17, 2022 Report",4.49

Aroma is bready and sweet with notes of figs and dates, candi sugar, caramel. Delicate and nicely balanced. Taste is likewise bready, balanced, and complex. One thing that stands out here, that I often don’t notice, is the quality of the water—clean and refreshing with a subtle mineral quality, like a cold spring. Caramel, dark stone fruits, Belgian yeast. Some vaguely wintery spice and subtle Old World hops. Mouthfeel is balanced and medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Finishes clean and crisp, just right. Overall, and not surprisingly, we have here a truly excellent, world-class dubbel. Maybe one of the best ones I’ve ever had. Apr 07, 2022 Report",4.47

Smells of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt and estery fruit and spice, with just a hint of dark fruit and chocolate also coming through. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt, chocolate and dark and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, fig, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of licorice and herbal, bitter hops. Finishes bittersweet, with notes of estery fruity and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation. This actually feels very close to their Quadrupel for me, except maybe being not quite as rich, a little more carbonated and just a tad more roasted and bitter. For my personal taste, I probaly prefer it, to be honest. Still, without being quite worth its secondary price, this makes for a very impressive Dubbel that just stands slightly above offering such as Westmalle, St. Bernadus and Chimay due to its richness, balance and above all body and mouthfeel, with the estery character really standing out here.

L- Even rested/chilled it forms head really fast, so pour super-slow. Pours deep chestnut brown with slight haze and a mid-tan 6Cm head. There's fast rising CO2 micro-bubbles up the side of the nucleated glass. ps. Holds well and forms major lacing on the way down. S- Strikingly deeply toasty and rich malts; it makes me imagine how a bag of ground up Maltesers might smell. T- Again very malty, deep roasty, a notably fat but classy ABV% note crosses my palate, off into hops, then further rich malts and into a hoppier somewhat dry finish. Solid yet refined. Blimey, if you think this beer's reputation is hype, wait until you try it! F- Rich deep roasty, the ABV% is clear enough it's similar to some liquor barrel aged beers. O- I picked this one for my 1950th review (the WestV12 will mark B2k). I was conscious of the brewery's repute and hype surrounding it, the difficulty getting their beer etc etc. Would I be underwhelmed, would I be underwhelmed but feel somehow obliged to rate it high. No way at all, this is a seriously luscious beer. Now perhaps some people might not like the fact that a 'mere' 8% beer lets you get an ABV% zing from it - some regard this as unclassy - but it works well within the rather glorious whole for me. I'd happily drink this again, hell-ya, just maybe not at the cost it is imported into the UK! 330ml bottle BB: [can't find on cap] Bought from a shop in Belgium as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London.

Toasted wheat and clove present up front, and even a bit of peppery spice comes out on the swallow. Touches of plum and date then accent the medium-light body, as its substantial froth collapses on the palate into a slick and easy semi-dry swallow pricked up by a bit of heat. An additional development of baked apple with hints of cinnamon and licorice crops up as it warms. This is definitely the most phenolic of the Westys, which makes sense for the style, for which this is a standard setter. Nov 24, 2020 Report",4.33

This smells like very bourbon forward in a nice way – caramel, toffee, oaky spice, with lots of dark chocolate, espresso, and roasted malt. This is good as it gets for just a regular old non-pastry barrel aged stout. There’s so much going on here with just stout and barrel. There’s distinct notes of coffee and vanilla, lots of dark and dense chocolate character, and lots of delicious bourbon. There’s also enough of a coconut flavor that you could be fooled that this had a little bit of coconut added. This is medium bodied, rich, not super thick or syrupy, like some modern stouts – it’s got just the right body. I’d only had the variants on this prior to having this classic original, and I think I prefer the OG the most. Aug 13, 2025 Report",4.76

Let's strip it open. Pop. Barely. Black. No head at all. Thus, perhaps, the Still. Light nose: pudding, bourbon, Hershey's. Midnight Still brings memories of the classics. Heavy bourbon, Hershey's Kisses, with a soft, sweet kiss of roast. Softer notes of rough oak & background bitterness, with a sweet, sweet finish. The feel is full but this is no current-fad pastry stout, more chalky, sticky. Despite the brain-scrambling ABV (this is your brain on Midnight Still, kids) I could drink more of this.

Drank this at that golf course I can't remember the name of up at Lake Tahoe. Has the requisite 'used motor oil' kind of pour in viscosity and appearance.  Aroma went hard on the bourbon and ashtray.  Behind that you had some chocolate like fudge notes and an even smaller vanilla quotient. Once again, bourbon dominates the taste, but it manages to push one of the biggest bourbon portfolio's without being too boozy or by eliminating all other beer aspects.  As if KBS was less coffee and chocolate but more bourbon.  Drinks smooth while still being able to drop some smoke and ash notes the whole time.  Hint of dark fruit creeps in as it warmed up on the back 9. I don't necessarily think this is better than the all time classics of barrel aging (KBS, Eclipse, BCS, CW), but it can definitely hang with them.  Would be interesting to see what the score for this would be if it were a lot easier to acquire, I imagine a little bit less, but not significantly.  It is top notch. Jun 19, 2020 Report",4.34

A- Oil black pour from the waxed bottle into a snifter. A small nutty brown foam layer appears on top of the beer with decent retention leaving spotty lace. S- Bang on balance of roast bittersweet stout and decadent sticky, aged distillery basement and oak bourbon barrels. The Bourbon alone is unreal, peppery spicy sticky booze and fruit notes. Fudge and rich cocoa balanced perfectly by boozy whiskey. Roast barley. Hints of vanilla. Truly Bourbon mastery. T- No arguing that the Bourbon is the star of the show but there is enough malt character to balance to near perfection. Bitter roast barley and fruity dark chocolate bars, french roast coffee beans, pepper, vanilla hints, brownies, boozy edge, caramel, oak wood degradation and nuttiness. Again it tastes like Buffalo Trace's sticky sweet bourbon barrel house. Strong oak bourbon malts but all pretty balanced, just HUGE. MF- Thick and slick oily monster. The booze tames the hefty body quite a bit finding a nice middle ground. Slightly creamy and chewy. Ends warm. The Bourbon barrel character in this beer is basically unmatched from what I have come across in the last ten years.

While the body of just about every stout I drink looks the same, the head, lacing etc. still leave room for differentiation, and it's in these ways that this one stands out.  While the head isn't robust (maybe a third of an inch), it has a wonderful dark tan hue, and it really sticks to the side of the glass.  The well above average lacing continues as I consume this.  The aroma is rich & chocolatey but with just enough roast. Whereas I couldn't detect any bourbon barrel on the nose, it's definitely there on the tongue.  Given the age of this, I wasn't sure it would still come through, but it definitely does, albeit in a balanced way.  It's the lightly bitter roast with just a little bit of sweetness on the finish that brings this all together.  Full bodied with pleasant, if well disguised alcohol warming. Overall, very good beer.

It actually lasts quite a while, but eventually surrenders and becomes a few islands with a solid ring, pretty strong cling. The smell is actually quite subdued to me. It's all there, but it doesnt seem to be eciting the glass with much urgency. Bourbon, great coffee and chocolate, roasty malts, a kind of caramel or molasses note, a light kiss of vanilla, wood. The flavor explodes. Everything that should be in a stout of this ilk, nothing that doesn't belong, and everything in its place. Very good bourbon flavor leads the parade. There's a superbly smooth coffee taste that combines with milk chocolate for a kind of mocha effect. The chocolate lingers a bit on the lips. A little bitterness from the coffee but no acridity or unpleasant cherry taste. Not much char at all, in fact. There's a pleasing woodiness - I guess that is barrel presence. A bit of vanilla, slight touch of sweetness. Well after the swallow there is an aromatic spicy anise taste. All these flavors are extremely well-integrated. Medium bodied, moderately carbed. It's not as dry as I thought it would be. Ultra-smooth, slightly bitter residual on the tongue while the licorice thing lingers as an aromatic. It occurs to me that it actually has a hard liquor feel to it. I can sit here and dissect, but this beer just as easily lends itself to good old enjoyment in its totality. While the bourbon is strong, my fellow Jedi, it somehow doesn't dominate with a heavy hand. It's just unabashedly there in the foreground, but everybody else stands up loud and proud. This is some awesome sauce in a can. Well-crafted and it seems the barrel aging is flawless - deserves every bit of hype it gets, if ya ask me. Mar 27, 2023 Report",4.49

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Reviewed by pulse from Ohio 4.32 /5 rDev -3.4% look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25 I believe this is #8 of the Extreme Stout Box, chosen by RNG. Ten FIDY pours black with a lovely khaki head, bubbly but fading rapidly into lacing. It has a noticeable enough aroma coming out of the can:  malty, chocolately, molasses, espresso, burnt sugar. Taste is interesting. It's similar to the other stouts from the box I have had recently in that it is rather big and smooth but also not lacking in complexity despite being rather straightforward compared to the more outlandish adjunct-laden bombs that are everywhere these days. It is very warming - I feel that right away. The coffee-chocolate bitterness is quite prevalent out front. The malty backbone carries through to the end. I get the vanilla, caramel, and residual sweetness for sure. Solid body with moderate carbonation. Some dark fruit juice builds up with more sips. For a box of extreme stouts, so many of these are terrifyingly drinkable. Mar 09, 2023 Report",4.32

Grabbed a 4pk. Canned on 11/11/22.  Rich, deep and dark brown with very modest but consistent mocha colored ring of foam, no real head and spotty but, scant lacing. The smell is pretty muted for me, definitely get some roasted malt and the bourbon has come out a bit as it warms. Strong roasted malt flavor, coffee-like.  A nice smack of the barrel that lingers through the finish.  A bit of oak, leather and unsweetened chocolate. Decent body and the sharpness from the booze is tolerable, it definitely lingers on the tongue and warms the gullet. An excellent beer for a chilly night. Mar 01, 2023 Report",

The aromas are right within the brewer’s description; bourbon, coffee, caramel roast malt, vanilla bean, warm wood oak, and chocolate. Flavorful. Coffee bitterness, chocolate caramel mix, a bit of vanilla, sweet and boozy. Coffee bitterness and hop bitterness do not compromise its smooth full body.

Part of my Super Bowl celebration to cheer on my Eagles! Pours a deep, opaque black color.  A quarter-finger, tan colored head that fades to a skim on the initial pour.  Sticky lacing clings to the side of glass throughout the drinking experience. After letting it warm up a bit, the brew blossoms with aromas of chocolate, roasted malts and a slightly boozy aroma. Damn, an excellent beer!  My initial reaction is “KBS” which is a high compliment.  Flavors of sweet chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and a slightly bitter aftertaste.  The bourbon barrel aging adds so much to this brew compared to the regular Ten Fidy.  It definitely imparts a distinct booziness to the beer.  A sipper for sure at 12.5%. Creamy, heavier consistency.  So silky smooth.  Leaves a boozy, tangy yet bitter aftertaste that begs you to take another sip. One on the best barrel-aged stouts that I’ve had.  Perfectly balanced.  Well worth the high BA rating.  Highly recommend and very happy I was able to try this brew.  Cheers! Feb 12, 2023 Report",

Stored at 34 degrees at home. Received in Beer Advocate Extreme Stout Box 2022 - $158.99 (Including tax and shipping) for the box containing 168 total oz of beer ($ 0.946/oz).  Re-reviewed 26/01/23.  Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Stamped on bottom of can “??HH?? 0? 11/12/22 ? “?2 ??0 ?43 OIL ??? YER EFF THE FIDY”.  Served at 58.2 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  The final temperature was 62.4 degrees. Appearance – 4. First pour – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), barely translucent. Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque.  Under direct light, same.  When rear lite, still opaque with light penetration at only the edges, ruby. Head – Large (Maximum 4.2 cm, aggressive center pour), buff, medium density with many rocks, average retention, dropping to an undulating 1.0 -1.4 cm crown fed by spotty carbonation, and a thin, rocky cap.  An irregular halo of bubbles remains on the glass above the crown Lacing – Poor – some broken bands of various size bubbles hang on the inside of the glass. Aroma – 4.25 – Roasted malt and chocolate with some bourbon in the background.  No hops, no yeast. Flavor – 4.25 – Roasted malt forward with a weak bourbon aftertaste, no hops, no yeast.  No ethanol (13.8 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste.  Mild gastric warming which just edges into the uncomfortable range.  No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends weakly sweet. Palate – 4 – Medium, short of creamy, soft carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4.25 Decent BBA Impy stout but not impressive.  The basic tastes of roasted malt and bourbon come through, but not any barrel oakiness – pretty much a two-trick beer.  At $4 a can, it’d be good; at $11.35 a can, not so much. Original review 26/03/18 Received in a ninja box from @Dragginballs76 – Thanks Michael! “Canned on 11/7/17” printed on the bottom of the can.  Stored at 42 degrees and served at 45 degrees in a hand-washed and dried Jester King snifter. Appearance – 4.5. Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. Head – Large (Maximum 7.3 cm, aggressive center pour), brown, medium density with rocks, slooowly diminishing to a four mm ring and layer.  Head retraction leaves open curtain lacing. Lacing – Wide complete rings of tiny to small bubbles. First pour – Dark brown, clear. Aroma – 4 – Strong chocolate fudge, slight amount of bourbon.  After head retraction, a bit of wood appears. Flavor – 4.25 – Tastes like bourbon barrel aged chocolate with some alcohol slipping in at the end.  I’m not picking up the vanilla or coffee others have mentioned.  Definitely no hop taste.  No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide. Palate – 4 - Full, creamy, soft carbonation. Impression and summation – 4.25 – This is almost too much of a good thing – the term “decadent” has been thrown around when describing this fluid and that seems to be accurate.  This is almost too rich and chocolatey to enjoy.  The alcohol is barely noticeable.  I’m glad I tried it – it never got to my area so without Mike I probably never would have – thanks again!

Hello old friend! Canned 11/12/22, it’s ready to drink right now. No need to put any age on this beauty. Aggressive bounce, nice heat. Full of flavor. The ‘22 version’s barrel choice is a kick to the head, streamlined and not as 10W40 as I recall. The elements are in order here; almost a Russian Imperial Stout in profile without making that claim. Dark malt and espresso. Plum and prune. Mouthwatering hop & alcohol burn add to a distinctly not-over-sweet Stout that finishes long.

Earthy plums or plummy earth, mixed with cold fireplace ash (oaken) and some 97%+ dark chocolate, The barrel is definitely present, but not overpoweringly center stage. Some deep black French roast or espresso character. As it warms, hints of shoe polish and raisin emerge, with the coffee notes becoming more pronounced and the barrel-char fading back a bit.

The lacing was just as impressive; it remained in the glass long after I finished. The aroma, while mild to my chemically damaged nose (Invest in a decent respirator people!) still got through some dark fruits (plums, raisins) and bourbon.  Hmm, smells pretty good. Taste followed, along with some coffee; both in the warmth of the initial sip and the bitterness of an overly roasted bean.  Interesting! The feel was also very good; viscous enough for the ABV but not chewy- just nice, smooth sipping. OA, this is a very good BA stout, and I'm a bit perplexed by it's sub top 100 in stouts ranking, but I suspect that means I just need to try more stouts. Also, in my opinion alone, I believe the non BA version to taste a little better.  I have to have them side by side to verify. May 25, 2022 Report",4.28

Great retention and lacing that belies its abv.  Like chocolate syrup with a toasted marshmallow on top. I'm not picking up much aroma this time.  Maybe it's too cold?  I get molasses, dark chocolate, espresso, and bourbon for sure, though. The flavor is dominated by rich dark chocolate, baking cocoa powder, espresso, bourbon, some butterscotch and caramel sweetness, tobacco, vanilla, oak, leather, and a hint of smoke.  Coffee and earthy bitterness lingers, tamed by hints of bourbon sweetness. The mouthfeel is thick, rich, oily, and fudgy.  Ample carbonation prevents it from being too sludgy. This is a wonderful BBA stout.  Rich in flavor, doesn't detract from the flawless base beer. Mar 20, 2022 Report",4.35

Hints of earthy oak and char, some wood notes that are somewhere between new oak and apple. Really hard to nail down in the most reassuring quest. And I am highly motivated to keep seeking.

Aromas on this are defined by charred oak, bakers chocolate and toasty spices among honey accompanied toffee. Drinks well balanced, showcasing a heavy bodied beer, inheriting a lower, subtle carbonation, which opens up the palate to the numerous facetts of the beer. Tastes of burned cotton candy among rustic, molasses and licorice accompanied toffee, together with lots of spicy, warming oak. Has an even sweeter, boozy mid palate, which never turns remotely too hot but instead offers a great interaction between almost resinous appearing oak and caramel brushed spices, dipped into luscious toffee. Finishes dry, yet soft, due to its silk mouthfeel with dried, alcohol soaked plums and raisins, smoothed by prevailing caramel and its matured oak qualities. A sweet and complex winter warmer indeed with just the right amount of heat to it, to let the beer‘s complexity slowly unfold onto the palate. Velvet, bold and sweet, with lots of oak and a nice combinated dryness, created by the alcohol and the matured hops in this, this is a very enjoyable beer. Dec 13, 2024 Report",4.46

Aroma is rich caramel, maple candy, brown sugar, creme brûlée, raisins, figs, rye spice, brown bread. Fresh and forward rye whiskey, charred oak, vanillin and coconut come from the barrel. Taste follows the nose well. Big barrel, as expected with the extended aging. Sugar Daddies, rich caramel, creme brûlée, maple, big rye spice both from the base and barrel, caramelized brown sugar, raisin, fig, plum, brown bread, oak tannin, big rye whiskey flavor, vanillin, slight coconut, some leather. Decadent, but balanced nicely by rye spice and barrel. Admittedly this is leaning a bit more sweet for my liking with a good amount of residual sweetness, but it's still top notch. Low full body. Rich and decadent, but with a drying oak tannin and rye spice. Oily, sticky, slightly creamy, and somewhat dense. Another winner from Revolution. This beer tends to lean sweet and this particular batch certainly does that despite highlighting the barrel selection.

Instantly on first sip I was a little bit worried that this was going to be too sweet – it’s decadently caramelly and honey-like, and almost fudgy up front, but then the rye comes in and dries this one right out pleasantly – spicy, leathery, and oaky, providing a nice blanket to balance this whole thing out. This is medium bodied, silky smooth, almost velvety, with a fudgy smooth finish. There’s no basically no hint of the booze, even at the really high ABV here. I expected this be a bit punchier – as regular VSOR is. It’s almost elegantly subtle for Revolution – providing balance and complexity over intensity. Mar 10, 2024 Report",4.41

Sampled on 02/11/21 $6.79 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a cloudy golden-orange body with heavy particulate in suspension. I'm glad that I know this is fresh! The head is a standard cap of white. The aroma is bright with pineapple, citrus pith, orange, pine, and sage. The flavor follows. The malt is sweetish and wheaty but otherwise basic. Hop notes include pineapple, pine, earthiness, spiciness (perhaps from alcohol  but at just 7.8% that's doubtful), herbs, orange, papaya, and mango. It's got a sild bitterness to it and it finishes quite dry with spiciness, earthiness, and pine swirling as it slowly fades. At this point I've got a clear layer of sediment on the bottom of the glass. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but I definitely don't feel great about it. It's OK I guess. The mouthfeel is full and smooth despite it having just a medium body so that's the trade-off. In the end it's certainly a tour de force that needs to be reckoned with but I don't feel it's as balanced and rounded as it could be. On the other hand, sometimes a little bit of brashness is welcomed. You'll have to try it for yourself and decide. Review #7,207 Feb 11, 2021 Report",4.32

All the gunk stayed safely compacted at the bottom of the bottle. Aroma is predominantly Band-Aid-ish phenols, some sweet, fresh nectarine, and a delightful apricot kernel/almond note with hints of creamy vanilla to round it out; overall it comes across as a farmyard funked-up peach melba. Tastes much the same, too, but more sour and less funky than anticipated. The 'whole fruit' flavour of the nectarines is amazing, almost like biting into the fresh fruit itself. Quite sour and quite fizzy; a smoother, softer mouthfeel would help carry the fleshy flavour of the fruit better, I think. But overall this is a remarkable fruit beer; the nectarine flavour keeps giving and giving. Jul 10, 2019 Report",

Thicket,"Reviewed by jrc1093 from Connecticut 3.56 /5 rDev -20.9% look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5 Blend No. 2 (2018 release); consumed on 1/14/21 Pours a deep, jet-purple body with an airy half-finger of extra-pale mauve head, retreating quickly to a few paper-thin, spotty islands of cap, a sizeable, bubbly collar, and virtually no lacing beyond an occasional splotching isolated at various points around the glass. Aroma shows fresh blackberry pits engaging with an increasingly rounded lactic funk, sharpwning over time while simultaneously embracing jammy blackberry and a deepening sweetness as the beer warms; old leather and wet stone peak over the middle into fresher oak and some grape-like tannins to close. Taste ooens with suggestions of blackberry quijcly overtaken by lactic funk and a splintery oak profile; hints of dried peppercorn pair with a sturdy tannic structure into a mid-palate of barnyard funk and lemon zest, while tones of blackberry pits, lactic funk, and a brief burst of red berries mark the finish. Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fine, moderate-mild carbonation; a huge acidity is sharp and biting over the mid-palate, acetic and puckering though crisp into back end; a brief juiciness dries steadily with slight tannic textures on the finish. Increasingly palatable as it warms, an overwhelming acidity remains dominant, relegating the blackberry to an underdeveloped background while largely glossing over the nuance of the funk; this wild ale is clearly designed competently and shows sporadic sparks of genuine depth, but a relentless imbalance ultimately takes away from the overall product.

Thicket,"Reviewed by SierraNevallagash from Maine 4.03 /5 rDev -10.4% look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4 Batch 2 - 375ml bottle - poured into a zin stem at 45°F. Pours a deep blackberry purple - foggy anf crimson when held to the light, with a lasting sudsy pinkish collar. The occasional rising bubble can be seen. Not as saturated, but quite similar to a merlot in appearance. Nose: Really wonderful blackberry presence here. That classic, instantly recognisable Side Project grist and culture character forms a simple foundation, with some toasty grain, bright acidity, and white oak, with subtle threads of hay, wheat, dusty leather, stone, petrichor, wet leaves, and lemon. The fruit is fresh, vibrant, and seedy, with an underlying jammy element. Reserved, but elegant. Palate: Thicket greets the palate with a sharp zing of acidity, with a ton of lacto-driven lemon juice pucker, and a bit of acetic bite following. Like many fruited Side Project wilds, there's an underlying sweetness that seems like it's from both the malt as well as some fructose. The sweetness tuns parallel to, but beneath the sourness, taming it a bit. The blackberry character is unmistakable, buy leans towards the dry, seedy, unripe, tart end of the spectrum, rather than juicy or saturated. The acidity is aggressive, and thankfully, burns fast and bright, settling down quickly, and revealing some grains and a bit of oak. Some ripe berry pokes through, along with some wine-soaked oak, finishing quick, clean, and dry. Mouthfeel/Body: Thicket is medium-light in body, wispy, fluid, and crisp. Puckering acidity up front causes some mouthwatering. Effervescence is fine, lively, amd sparkly. The finish is dry, with some very subtle oak tannins. Overall: This is one of those wild ales that could have been stellar if it wasn't so acidic. The reviews are polarising - some saying it's jammy, others, that it's crazy sour. As it warms, some ripe berry sweetness does begin to emerge, which helps a lot, and it does become enjoyable, but the aggressive acidity holds it back and stifles the complexity. It's certainly fruit-forward, and very much Side Project, but it isn't the most balanced or complex offering. This one is good, but not amazing. Jan 14, 2021 Report",4.03

Vintage 2022. Got it from @ozzylizard in NBS BIF #17. Pours black with no head, looks still. Smell is bourbon and vanilla, burnt toffee and near-burnt nuts, sweet molasses, hint of something like cinnamon or nutmeg. Taste is (for me) dominated by cinnamon. Nuts are still there, and something comes across as milk chocolate. Molasses sweetness. I was feeling a little bit of spice on my lips and thinking it was a bit odd for cinnamon to have that much power but not be totally overwhelming for me, and then I read on the label that it contains habaneros, and that's clearly evident now that I saw it. As it's warming up, the cinnamon is becoming even more powerful. Mouthfeel is nicely thick and chewy. Overall...it appears to be a pretty good stout with a nice level of pepper, but too much cinnamon for me. Jul 03, 2023 Report",3.88

Received from brewery 05/04/23. Reviewed 10/04/23 (Review 3070).  Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Printed on the label “2022”.  Stored at 34 degrees at home.  Served at 54.6 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 59.0 degrees F. Appearance – 3.75. First pour – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), almost opaque. Body – Deep Brown (SRM 30), opaque.  Under direct light, same. When rear lite, shows a translucent olive at the top edge and ruby at the bottom. Head – None.  While pouring, a five mm crescent of large bubbles appears on about a third of the circumference but quickly evaporates. Lacing – None. Aroma – 4.25 – Bourbon and barrel are the predominant aromas, no malt, no yeast, no hops, no chocolate.  Oddly, no habaneros.  No ethanol (13.7 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma. Flavor – 4.5 – The habaneros set up a nice oral burn, not too hot and lacking any vegetal flavor.  Cinnamon rides in on the aftertaste.  Initially no hops, malt, or yeast; light chocolate and ghostly vanilla.  Slight gastric warming, but that could be from capsaicin as well as ethanol.  No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Palate – 4 – Medium; creamy; soft carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4.25 Lacking both head and lacing, the appearance loses a few points.  Both the flavor and aroma are quite good, with distinct hits of habaneros, cinnamon, cocoa, and even detectable vanilla, all supported by the bourbon and barrel.  Very good and well worth grabbing if you run across a bottle or six.  Extra points for having a lizard on the label. Apr 10, 2023 Report",
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Reviewed by Blogjackets from Ohio 4.4 /5 rDev -1.8% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle, the body is a dark cola brown. Small initial head that quickly dissipated and no lacing of consequence. Aroma is a complex mix of bourbon, cinnamon, vanilla, and chile. The habanero aroma is muted but present. Taste follows nose though the barrel is a tad sweeter than the nose. You'll need to be patient to pick up the notes of walnut and oak rising from the stout upon which this beer was made (Oil of Aphrodite). The habanero is felt in the swallow, but it's a light heat. In fairness, I love habs and you might perceive more heat. The cinnamon and cacao nibs balance the pepper and the barrel holds everything together in an unlikely tasty stout. A bit more malty char would be welcome, but that's a personal preference and not a complaint. Mouthfeel is good but not great. I'd love a bit more body in this stout. More carbonation would be welcome. Overall an outstanding stout that I interestingly found a bit better when colder than I usually drink stouts. The mix seemed more flavorful when first poured.

Smells of slightly roasted, caramel malt and distinct chocolate and vanilla notes, as well as some cinnamon and hints of licorice and oak. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, caramel malt, strong milk chocolate and vanilla, lighter cinnamon and chili heat, as well as hints of dark fruit, with accents of raisin and fig, licorice, leather and bourbon-infused oak. Finishes with a light sweetness and some chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and a pleasant chili heat lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation. It's been so long since I managed to get my hands on a decent mexican chocolate stout, so this BBA brew goes down a real treat. I've had regular Oro Negro before and really enjoyed it, while  the BBA version feels a lot richer, with the bourbon character coming through marvellously here. While this also makes the beer a little bit more sweet and boozy, with that bourbon and additional vanilla notes really standing out, the spice and roasted notes balance this out very nicely, with the chili heat being just right for my personal taste. Overall, this makes for a very rich mexican chocolate stout with an excellent balance of sweet and spicy notes and a great bourbon character, as well as full body and mouthfeel.

L: Poured an inky black with no real head to speak of, and what little did form vanished quite swiftly. S: Thick black bread leapt out of the bottle upon the cap being removed, and swirled in the air during the pour. Alongside it, blackstrap molasses, petrichor with fresh herb garden topsoil, chopped walnut, and oaky booze are prominent in the nose when cold. As it warms, the walnut aroma becomes far more prevalent. T: When cold, this opens as a mouthful of herb garden soil just after a spring rain, with both chopped walnut and wet green walnut husk present. Black bread lurks in the background, and oaky tannic barrel notes slither around the edges. The aftertaste contains a touch of spicy heat. As it warms, those characteristics remain, but additional layers begin to appear - some dark sugary fruit like raisins, figs, and dates, molasses, a tinge of leather, and some distant cocoa. The heat remains in the aftertaste. F: Full and thick, this brings to mind liquid bread blended to syrup. O: This is a complex delight of a barrel-aged stout. But hey, it's Jackie O's.

The foam that forms on the beer is a light brown and has a puffy texture. The head rises to a finger high and has decent retention. Not a ton of lacing but a few small webs and some spottiness. S- Woah, didn't expect the walnuts to make a massive difference but the first thing I smell upon pouring the bottle, from a few feet away, is toasted walnuts. The nuts combine with the roasted malts, which are chocolately and fudgey, as well as some caramel notes to remind me of turtles or a nutty, caramel chocolate treat. Bourbon barrel comes next with some vanilla sweets, slight wood and hints of whiskey. Strong cocoa as well as hints of earthy cinnamon. Not picking up on the peppers here. T- Not quite as nutty as the aroma but the walnuts are still present throughout and one of the main flavors along with the cocoa and the barrel which gains considerable strength on the palate. A bit of habanero heat in the finish but no obvious pepper flavor, which is probably a good thing if we are being honest. Vanilla beans are strong with caramel, milk chocolate, roast barley, spicy Bourbon, medium toast oak and spicy cinnamon notes. MF- Medium bodied and a little bit thinner than I expected after smelling and tasting this one. I guess it just lacks creaminess and is lightly frothy instead. Fairly slick and oily but not syrupy. The carbonation is moderate and it finishes with moderate alcohol warming and some heat from the peppers. Reminds me of a walnut, caramel and chocolate cluster and I am impressed by how much the walnuts are expressed in the final brew. The flavor is where things really balance out nicely but the body could be just a bit creamier if I am being honest. Dec 31, 2020 Report",4.29

Online description read, “Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro is a dynamic beer brimming with layers of complexity and character. An imperial stout brewed with walnuts, aged in bourbon barrels for a year, and conditioned on vanilla beans, cacao nibs, habaneros, and cinnamon sticks.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Reviewed by jkblr from Indiana 4.53 /5 rDev +1.1% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 12.7oz bottle (2019 vintage) poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 12.1% ABV.  The beer pours dense, very dark brown with chocolate tan colored head.  The head builds slowly on a hard pour and quickly fades to a thin ring and tiny bit of lacing.  The aroma is strong with bourbon first, then vanilla, cacao and spice.  The taste is semisweet caramel and chocolate malts with big bourbon easing into nice pepper flavor and heat with the vanilla, cinnamon & cacao on the finish.  Minimal bitterness as the spicy heat and drying barrel balance the big malt bill perfectly.  The mouthfeel is full to medium bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall, outstanding.  This is a destination beer.  So many things going on without being busy.  No hint of alcohol as the habaneros & cinnamon mask what little might be there.  Recommended if you enjoy spiced stouts along with bourbon barrel aging. Feb 25, 2020 Report",4.53

It pours a turbid, pastel tangerine color with a big, bright white cap of pillowy foam and thick film of lacing.  The nose is classic Citra:  grapefruit, pineapple, and ripe melon, augmented by the sweet notes of oat cream.  The taste follows although the oat and milk sugar sweetness is more pronounced.  While the citrus flavors are bright and tart, there is minimal hop bitterness.  The taste is almost delicate. Its mouth feel is super plush and creamy and the 10.5% ABV is extremely well-hidden.  It is amazingly drinkable for a TIPA; in fact, I have to pace myself. Overall, Triple Citra Daydream is an impressive Triple.  Many a brewer has ruined a good recipe by trying to drive up the ABV.  No problem here. It is vintage Other Half and that says a lot. Feb 16, 2025 Report",4.43

I’m very excited to try this one knowing the quality that Other Half consistently pushes out. Let’s get right into it Pours a hazy milky yellow with 3 fingers of dense off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing The nose has such a nice snap here, but there’s still a rounded softness to it. I’m picking up on aromas of orange juice, pineapple juice, grassy hops, bready malt, red grapefruit, white pepper, sweet vanilla, lychee, dank weed, and light mango It keeps up that same balance of smooth with a bite in taste as well. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting underripe mango, orange juice, resinous hops, bready malt, pineapple juice, dank weed, light grass, and red grapefruit. The swallow brings notes of orange juice, sweet vanilla, bready malt, pineapple juice, resinous hops, lemon zest, underripe mango, light lychee, white pepper, and grass A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a silky and juicy beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks well below its abv This is awesome stuff.

Taste is all Citra, all orange juice, but with accents of vanilla and creamcicle milkshake. The alcohol is not invisible and makes itself known. It  gets a bit sweet and cloying as it sits.

Orange juice concentrate, kumquat, yellow grapefruit, creamsicle, hint of dankness T -- Again, citrus of all sorts dominates here (not surprisingly). There's a decent creamy sweetness from the lactose and a neutral malt character from the oat and wheat. Perhaps most impressive is the complete lack of booziness despite the high ABV.

Upon opening and pouring the beer into a snifter, the chunk remained at the surface which shifted to the bottom of the bottle mid-pour, so I was able to pour the last dregs into a smaller glass where the tan clump plopped out. It was actually hard to the touch as I plucked it from the surface of the beer. My concern began to grow because these Florida pastry stouts usually only have small flakes of more dispersed coconut lipids, which melt instantly and have almost no feel to them. Thankfully, just before my flashbacks of mouse skull chicken McNuggets fully manifested, it did begin melting in the palm of my hand. Anywho, the body is viscous black with other minor spots of oils surfacing after the burnt mocha blanket quickly disappears to nothing at all. Smell is Butterfinger with vanilla bean white chocolate and hints of caramel corn. As it warms, charred mocha coffee and brownie crust emerge. The aroma is hypnotizing. Taste is decadent and a little boozy as the apple brandy barrel makes its presence known, adding sharp oaky liquor notes to the extravagant flavors of coconut filled pâte à choux with chocolate ganache. The body is just thick enough to dampen the barrel to tolerable levels of booze, allowing for additional notes of cinnamon coffee and vanilla custard to surface. The finish is semi-sticky and substantially warming all the way down. May 29, 2019 Report",4.33

Finishes with a nice rind bitterness; 6/10 on my scale. Mouthfeel is light bodied and very refreshing. Overall a very nice NEIPA, full of flavor and refreshing! Oct 12, 2021 Report",4.43

I bought two packs today in Durham, NC. canned on 7/1/2021. Poured into a pint glass. It pours an opaque, tangerine color with a half finger of foamy, milk-white head and thick, soapy lacing. Its smell features bright lemon, lime, grapefruit, tangerine, and some delightful, floral notes. Wow, the taste is something else! The Citra offers huge, sweet citrus:  lemon, lime, orange, pineapple, and ripe honeydew melon. It just pops.  It's amazing that all this flavor comes from a single hop. The mouth feel is moderately creamy with near perfect carbonation, and at 7.1% ABV it's readily drinkable.  Overall, Citraquench'l is everything it purports to be and more! It's absolutely delicious. One of the best New England IPAs I've had the pleasure to drink. Just terrific! Jul 19, 2021 Report",4.59

Hard black with a few stray brown bubbles that quiet swiftly. Oh Oh. Cinnamon bite is strong on the nose. Please, no, brew deities. Reaction State tiptoes along the abyss of cinnamon gorge. Cinnamon is straddling the beer but doesn’t quite crush it into submission. Underneath the spice are touches of maple, vanilla, & the ghost of cocoas past. Light bourbon winds its way betwixt & between & the finish is mulled apple cider. Should have split this one with my wife. Hey brewers: quit putting so much fucking cinnamon in your beers.

Just a half of a finger of dark brown head shows up and disappears just as quickly. Nose is a walloping of bourbon barrel aged stout. Its got that rich, dense, still wet barrel level of intensity. Huge oak profile. I love it. Next is the roasted malt and a strong presence of chocolate. This reminds me a little of one of my favorites of all time; Weyerbacher's Chocolate Pretzel Sunday Morning Stout. Then in the background, there lies the cinnamon. Taste is much of the same on the nose. Oak, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, cinnamon. But now I get the slight bit of maple syrup. Maple syrup presents almost with, I hesitate to say this, but a sour note when its put in stouts sometimes. Like an extremely subtle tartness or tanginess. It doesn't detract, but it is a unique quality. The tannins from the barrel kind of leave that soapy flavor that also sometimes tends to happen in these barrel aged stouts. Its incredibly mild and doesn't linger, but thats why I decided to put it at a 4.5 rather than 4.75, similar to the nose. Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Brief flash of carbonation right at the beginning. ABV makes its presence known, but not as severely as that Maumasi I had the other night. There is a little bit of drying but not harsh on the palate or on the way down. Overall my favorite Bottle Logic brew so far. I was surprised because I though this was just going to be another ""breakfast stout"", but this one actually blew me away. Well balanced and all the flavors work well with each other and don't feel like novelty additions. Masterclass level stuff. Dec 11, 2022 Report",4.57

My third beer from Russian River and so glad my son brought me one as it’s not to be missed, cheers! Oct 27, 2024 Report",4.44

There's almost no head, but that's the standard Philly pour. Its color is very bright and lightly copper-amber. There's a fresh, but not pungent aroma of floral hops and malt. Despite sparse glass lacing, it's delightfully carbonated. To taste, it's a great hop and malt balance. That works for the tongue, but runs the mouthfeel a little too thinly, especially for an IPA. The 7% ABV is nicely incorporated into the overall taste. The finish is clean, but a little light in flavor for an IPA. Fifteenth best American IPA, how? It's so much better than the oat and wheat infused common American IPAs, but that's a low bar. This is a very good beer, perhaps almost flawless in what it provides.

Flavor is pale malt, citrus, piney and dank hops, catty dankness, grapefruit, lemon and light mixed tropical fruit. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. My first opportunity to try this Pliny variant, even though I was eligible to vote when it first came out. Typical hoppy burst when opened, although somewhat subdued from regular Pliny. The initial part of the taste is very much much like the standard version, but lots of complex herbal hop flavors develop into a hoppy, pleasantly bitter finish. Lots of flavors to parse for a second each. I still remember my first Pliny and the amazing burst of hops on opening followed by more hop herbals than I'd experienced before. This one is not quite as bitter and somewhat less of the intense citrus and pine, but the hop bill is fine and interesting.

Notes on label: ""For this Schaarbeekse Kriek, we macerated locally grown and manually harvested sour cherries for almost fourteen months in wooden barrels, with both one-year and two-year old lambik. The final fruit intensity is about 318 grams of Schaarbeekse per litre of finished Schaarbeekse Kriek. The average age of this beer upon release will be at least two-and-a-half years."" Clear, cherry red colored body. Fizzy head quickly disappeared. No lacing. Aroma is cherry, funk and oak. Funk is more leather and tobacco like. Indications of sourness but the oak gives off an old wood fibe. Taste is quite sour, each sip leaves the mouth dry. There is a sour cherry flavor that still gives off a brief hint of fruit sweetness. At this time the funk flavor is showing less than what is in the nose, but remains in the leather and tobacco expression. Has quite a bit of oak tannins, especially on the exhale of the breath and in the released air from the stomach. Medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.

This smells of candided cherries, inheriting an utmost fruity and flowery composition, together with a lusciously fruit ripeness. Got a marzipan peak to it, revealing toasted cherry piths, as well as a subtle, funky leatheriness. The nose on this is simply phenomenal, revealing an intriguing complexity which is hard to find in a beer. Has a soft, vivid carbonation, which leads to a great refreshment in this light bodied, smooth drinking beer. This tastes of an initial, complex funkiness consisting of green apples, blue cheese and old basement, blended together with some additional leather, complimenting the uprising cherry fruitiness in this. The fruits got an intense ripe- and sweetness to them, featuring the unique marzipan flavor from the nose, as well as a gentle, subtle smokiness. Finishes rich and juicy with an underlying, balancing tartness, toasted cherry piths among a stony mineral quality, entagled into wet hay and lime zest, creating a refreshing, long lasting aftertaste. This is a perfect Kriek to me. The cherries in this work their magic in an astonishing way, they‘re incredibly prominent and complex, at the same time this drinks easy and simply enjoyable. The mouthfeel is velvet, yet sparkling during the finish, the funk is there too, together with a very well working tartness,  which makes this quite unique, as far as cherries can define a beer.

An inch-tall, tight and creamy, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, lasting collar. Streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass. The aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. Moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. Bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. As the beer sat, sweet, creamy lactose notes appeared. Good dose of vanilla as well. Chocolate syrup was also noticeable. The sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat. The flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. Malty and robust up front. Roasted malts were most apparent. Moderate caramel malt presence too. Cold coffee was also noticeable. Subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. Slightly sweet. More roastiness on the back end and the finish. Moderate amount of bitterness. Some alcohol warmth came through as well. Nice creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Slightly syrupy. The liquid contained a finer beaded, somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate. All That Is And All That Ever Will Be is an enjoyable beer, though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest. Both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat.

A very enticing aroma here Up front in the taste I get a nice balance of char and sweet chocolate. On the swallow, it become evident why this is a milk stout. Layered with juicy raisin, rich chocolate, and light coffee roast, this is sweet but absolutely fucking brilliant This has a medium full body with light tingly carbonation, leading to a finish that is a touch sticky and sweet. The relatively low alcohol content almost feels like a joke, as this drinks like a beer that is over 10% Well, it’s certainly true when they say this drinks bigger than it actually is. I’m floored by the way they coax huge flavors out of something with such a low abv. Bravo guys, this exceeds some of their IPAs Jul 30, 2020 Report",4.52

I always try and do something a little special for these milestone reviews (I did Blessed for #1000 last year), so this one fits the bill. Beer obtained in a trade. Bottled 11/21/18, consumed on 4/5/25. Blue wax top bottle. Mostly stored at 55°F, but recently stuck into the colder temps of my refrigerator. Let out at RT for ~30 mins before pouring into a Spiegelau wheat beer glass, paired with almonds. Enjoyed outside in the sun. A&S: There was only a tiny little carbonation pop when opening, so you could tell right away the carb was going to be a little lower on this one. Unique look. Large bubbles gather on the bottom of the glass and slowly rise to the top. Transparent canary yellow colored beer, until the second half is poured in and then it turns opaque and mustard colored. The pour causes a dusting of white head to appear before disappearing. No lacing. I wouldn't say this beer is a looker, but it's pretty old, too. The aroma contains apricots, yeast, green apples, and a little bubblegum. During the second pour I start getting citrus (oranges) as well. Even with the warming-up period, this beer's smell took a while to come through. T&M: The taste really drives this beer for me. The taste is pretty tart and acidic and contains oak, unripened peaches, white wine, peppery brett spice, and musty/ goaty funk. It's dry but not crazy dry. The mouthfeel is elegantly smooth. It has just enough carbonation so its not flat, but not fizzy in any way. It goes away from the traditional saison crispness, but it's fitting for the beer. Overall: I was a little worried about this beer after seeing and smelling it initially, but this beer really came around in this and the other categories. Lives up to the billing!

Nonetheless, the preceding kick-off presents a spumescent elegance, as the stretch reaches to inches ahead of that ensuing regression. That initial onset categorizes those collared inches from Arabian Oryx to shredded coconut, before the unseating takes a painter’s knife to the pebbly brim. Just below is a presentation on appearance that succumbs the Golden Shield Lichen, with a Tuscan sun appeal. The output continues with intermittent transfers, which later transcribe hues in chartreuse, as shades of dim scarlet calmly intersect. During the walk, a growing classiness from air drafts of duration, which polish an engraving collar endowment with coupled calm clarity S: Entryway is greeted by an involvedness preempted by esters, and a countryside funk that’s just setting off. In that regard, the indulgence stretches across citrus fruits with a ploughed rusticity that incises the herbed wheat kindly. The scents carry on towards cameo apples besides the pear drop to honey bananas, while pink & white grapefruit alloy the baboon lemon kind of limes. There’s a touch of grainy malt, for the cracker-y moments, which respect the advancing yeast properties to umbrella remote spices. In the interim, a distant dank earthiness, for fresh hay and cut pastures, while pulling a dragged mustiness out from barnyard phenols. The aerated openness channels oak to the finer points inside dry/calibrated wine, as a background frowzy lays horse blankets atop cellar moths. The forward march is neatly acidic, while continuing to press earthy must on fading rose petals, before the dry & brittle antiques of wooden leather T: A mineralogy reading, for foretaste to indulge, with the accompanying fruit + spices relating to the harvested derives. Inferences campaign on earthy farmsteads with feedlot jazz and cultivated tobacco, as a tempered acidity roots crimson red rhubarbs. On balance, a light malt baking to field hops with a toasted spiciness, while yeast properties grind along a rural bitterness. Accordingly, grassy provinces with situated granaries that stow garnered wheat. The vintage addresses contextual funk, and pushes agricultural sulfates thru river rock mulch, as fungus builds upon the air-dry acclimations. There’s a developing cue of Grüner Veltliner, by the elongated pour for grape tinges, and a furtherance for cellar natures. To that end, a docility on acidity, as notations add oddity for woodlot ecology and slurry manure, afore dry skin briefcases M: A bright, light buoyancy with antiquated funk, and sharp vibrancy. The allotted span comes with arbitrated tartness, which is moderated throughout, as a compliment to the progressed barrenness. Thus, a thrilling attenuation that styles effervescence handily, as the timed exposure madcaps the resounding involvedness from side to side upon the clean-complete finish O: An environmental showcase that harvests funk habitually, with a touch of wheat malt in back to weigh hop efficiency. The moment of service is a period of effectiveness, given the dry bite for the webbed yeast densities and age aligning land-locks Dec 13, 2021 Report",4.46

Smells of faint grass, orange zest, moldy wood and a slighty acidic sourness. Has a very refreshing, lighter mouthfeel, balanced by a vivid, sparkling carbonation. Tastes of sour lemons, mellowing oak and a lighter funkiness from first glance, unreveling a very prominent sourness. Among old leather and more oak the funkiness gets pushed back a little by stale, sweeter malts, adding to the complexity of the tartness in this. Finishes calmer, with almost nothing prevailing but a long going sourness, producing a stonger acetic nuance. Quite nice for what it is, with its complexity not being in the same ballpark as any of the available Belgian beer‘s at the event of comparable style. Sep 21, 2019 Report",3.58

Pkgd 11/17/21.  13.4% ABV, 12oz bottle. Pours out to a syrupy thick ink black, forming a thick dark cocoa head with average retention, sparse lacing.  The nose is definitely full of bourbon but on top of that classic expedition nose we all love...prunes, dark chocolate, raisins, figs, soy sauce and black walnut.  Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy, dense bodied.  Medium light carbonation, ~2.25 carbs or so.  Taste is a recap of the nose.  The bourbon is well balanced with the other complex stuff going on here and gives it a more warming presence that traditional Expedition. Bitterness is mild and earthy, hops are kept in check by copious malts.  Considering the rich complex malts, there is no sourness or astringency here...this easily happens in lesser RIS's if the roasted malts are overdone. One is enough.  It's a heavy hitter and very rich.  This might be great over dark chocolate ice cream.  Hrmmm.  Might have to try that. Feb 19, 2022 Report",4.38

Foggy Window,"Reviewed by papposilenus from New Hampshire 4.34 /5 rDev -3.3% look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 From a 16oz can, dated 08/29/23. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass. Cap-tip to @franktank18  for his resourcefulness, incidental generosity, and just how murderous he looks in a tie. Pours an opaque milky orange with two fingers of airy, whipped egg white-like foam. Retention is fairly decent, leaving a fizzy cap and sudsy, slippery lacing. Nose is pretty faint but, what there is of it, seems to me sugary, candy-like. Aroma of lemon drops and orange LifeSavers. Taste is less sweet than expected, drier and more tart. Tasting lemon rind, tangerine and gooseberries. Some astringency standing in for actual legitimate bitterness - but not such that I’d care to complain about it. Feel is dry and drying, clean and maybe feeling a bit lighter bodied than it really is due to fairly aggressive bright and fizzy carbonation. There’s a mildly acidic and boozy smoulder in the gullet, not unexpected given the abv. Overall, tasty and gone all too soon. In accordance with can instructions I shall now refrain from operating machinery for some appropriate period of time. Sep 14, 2023 Report",4.34

Very tropical aroma here. The aroma leans toward sweet tropical to me. Mango, and guava seem to be the main aromas, with a hint of pineapple in the mix. Taste - The flavor follows the nose and the hops are more sweet. Lots of mango and guava going on here. They hit hard and early on in the mix. The finish is more tart and a hint of bitterness, which leans toward pineapple. That flavor isn't too strong, but there. The body  is pretty damn soft and juicy feeling.

Massive pillowy head that leaves gorgeous lacing down the glass. Nose offers creamy orange and mango and a touch of diesel. Flavour actually opens with some lightly grainy malts before the hazy hops take over. It doesn't bring the bright rich fruit forward that I anticipated, instead opting to mostly forgo the initial pulse, and slowly creep up to a pithy and underripe fruit bitterness that carries through to the finish. There's a little bit of spicy/papaya dancing in there as well, and that pithy citrus finish builds and builds and builds and tastes like I'm chewing on an orange rind by the time I'm halfway through the glass. Body is moderate and smoothe with a sticky bitter finish and a sharp carpet of carbonation. Thank you for sending this along, Tim, I'm glad to have gotten to try it myself!! Dec 08, 2022 Report",3.88

Crackery malt backbone provides a nice canvass for the hops to shine on. That woody bitterness lingers into the finish. It provides a nice balance to the moderate sweetness.

Definitely some citrus peel - grapefruit again comes to mind. Leather, dirt, a floral note, and more grapefruit on the aftertaste. In fact, the aftertaste is almost identical to the bitter grapefruits that I get from our tree in the backyard when they are a bit under-ripe. The pineapple is there on the taste, but it pales in comparison to what was on the nose. The hop bitterness definitely overshadows the tropical fruit on the taste.

Peche Du Fermier,"Reviewed by Harrison8 from Missouri 4.55 /5 rDev +1.1% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5 Pours bright orange with a foggy transparency. Head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. A few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass, but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. The level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass-  it develops a more murky appearance, with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is immediate peaches, but they're soft and delicate. It leans slightly into tart, but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. Faint cellar stone, oak, and grass occupy the rest of the nose, rounding out the depth. Peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish. Just like the nose, the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature, and with that, it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. Still no puckering sourness, but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. No puckering or tart finish, with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. It nearly falls flat on the tongue, with the initial portion being crisp. Overall, peach addition is wonderful, with the rest of the profile being a steadfast, focused, and balanced saison. It's not overly acidic or tart, providing just enough tartness to offer contrast, without forcing it into sour territory. Blend #2. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle.

Having had a Framboise du Fermier earlier in the day, this has a relatively toastier sesame seed cracker malt and oak interplay that is likely assisted by not being anywhere nearly as sour. The frothy medium body is so much more balanced, with a just lightly tart herbal peach skin presence accented by a nutty funk. This is actually delicate by comparison to FdF, and as such, so much more enjoyable. However, we also had a few de Garde brews before this, and the comparison to the kings of stone fruit out in the Pacific Northwest is a stark one, no matter how formidable the challenger.

Smells of riper peaches, old wood and bread dough among a lighter, stony pith quality. Got a lighter glue and blue cheese funkiness underneath, giving the fruit in this a nice little twist. Drinks light, with an omnipresent acidity, balanced by a higher, refreshing carbonation. Tastes of sun ripened peaches, not yet to the point of getting jammy though, due to a present acidic sourness, hitting the palate uncompromising. Turns a tad effervescent then, with a noteable mineralic note, wrapped up by older, oaken wood, adding a pleasant, funk accompanied complexity to the flavors. Finishes calmer, with maintaining sweet peaches, building a well working counterpart to the teeth numbing sourness in this, which the peaches manage to overcome during the aftertaste. Very well rounded, fruited sour with a great balance to it, pushing successfully further than most other AWAs. Oct 27, 2019 Report",3.92

Taste-  Coffee, cacao, ancho chili pepper, pepper heat builds throughout the bottle, moderately sweet, moderately bitter, high strength of flavor. Feel-  Medium body, average carbonation, moderately bitter, moderately sweet, highly mouth warming, silky, moderately creamy, mildly mouth coating. Overall-  Excellent appearance, even had great head retention and lacing which some big ABV stouts lack.  Aromatics were dominated by coffee with some ancho pepper able to make its way through.  The flavor was again dominated by coffee, but not as much as the nose.  I couldn’t detect any vanilla or cinnamon that was promised by the label in the smell or taste, but I got some dark chocolate notes to go with the coffee and pepper in the flavor profile.  Overall the flavor had high intensity and as long as you are a coffee fan you will be good to go.  The body was thinner than expected for the style and did not provide as much mouth coating property as I thought it would.  Bitterness and mouth warming properties matched my expectations.  Overall this was a solid beer that provided a good drinking experience.  But, it was not close to meeting expectations for the price of admission and by far my least favorite Abraxas to date.

I shied away from this beer because the original Abraxas I tried was awful. I hope this beer is different. I am serving the beer at 50 degrees in a tulip glass. The pour created a half-fingered, dark tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The color is coal black with dark rusty brown hues. It is semi-transparent and charting at SRM 36. Overall, it is a below-average showing for a high-ABV stout. Nosing the glass, I smell toffee, dark-roasted coffee, chili, cinnamon, a skosh of char, Maillard, vanilla, dark chocolate, dark-roasted malts, light dusty barn, treacle, caramel, brown sugar, earthiness, and malty sweetness. Sipping the glass, I taste dark chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, treacle, char, espresso, toffee, molasses, caramel, leather, dates, chili, earthiness, malty sweetness, Maillard, and tobacco. The mouthfeel is chewy and coating, with a silky, soft, and warm finish. The body is heavy and low in carbonation. I can see the hype for Abraxas, the first one I tried was terrible. This beer is brimming with flavors of dark roasted coffee, chili, cinnamon, vanilla, dark roasty notes, and dark chocolate. The coffee is full-bodied, yet the other flavors can shine through. The adjuncts used are also ideally placed, and the beer sings harmoniously and balanced. A fantastic beer! May 10, 2025 Report",4.65

Look - Pours a very dark clear reddish black color with a nice head that quickly disappears.  Maybe just a bit more head than the other Abraxas stouts. Smell - Honestly, I think this has a very similar smell to the Bombraxas.  Cinnamon, malt, light chili pepper, light vanilla.  Maybe this is just a slight bit heavier on the coffee scent, and though I'm not a huge coffee fan, that seems to make this smell a tad better. Taste - Same thing on the taste.  It's very similar to the Bombraxas - notes of cinnamon, malt, light chili pepper, and light vanilla - though this may have just a bit more coffee.  I'll rate them about equal, since I'm not a huge coffee fan. Feel - It has a nice feel to it. Nicely carbonated and easy drinking at 10.5% with a pleasant aftertaste.

Nose evokes coffee up front, but the Abraxas spice makes its presence felt. Taste starts a little sweeter, with a light tang, maybe somewhat berry-like.  Coffee roast gets pushed back by this, but sneaks out from under in the mid-taste.  Spice exists, and has a vague enveloping warmth, but without the depth from the nose. If the taste more closely paralleled the nose, this would gain a few ticks up from me.  Still a very fun beverage to drink. Mar 12, 2025 Report",4.23

Dark brown verging on black, a healthy frothy head and lacing. Strong cinnamon, coffee, and pepper scents over a roasty chocolatey base. Well blended mix of all the above adjunct flavors, with coffee in the forefront but everybody playing nicely with each other. Like the regular Abraxas, it’s almost understated in flavor, which works well. Almost light bodied for such a big beer, not oily or thick in the least. Just all around a winner of a beer.

Jam The Radar,"Reviewed by sulldaddy from Connecticut 4.44 /5 rDev -0.9% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25 Sampling a 2021 vintage bottle poured at cellar temp into my snifter. Been in my cellar for several weeks after receipt in a trade. Label says Batch 005, not sure that means anything.  My bottle also says 14.56% ABV. The beer pours a black coffee color and very fizzy but minimal tan head foams up and is gone instantly, leaving only the thinnest of edge layers as any evidence of carbonation. Aroma on this beer is dark chocolate, brown sugar , a bit of bourbon, but surprisingly no raspberry notes.  Hops absent on the nose and booze doesnt reveal any fusol notes on the aroma. The first sip reveals a lighter body than expected, but still in the medium range. Texture is fairly smooth and doesnt have much stickiness to it.  Carbonation is very fine, sort of fleeting and borders on being still.  Id say overall the physical traits are not really what I expected from a bigger imperial stout. Flavor is chocolate bar and bourbon with a bit of cocoa powder dryness and then a blast of raspberries.  WOW! That is fruity.  The fruit dominates till I swallow and lingers also.  Sort of a chocolate covered raspberry note with a creamy candy taste.  I swear I keep getting banana, even though Im sure its the overabundance of raspberry tricking me. Never any hop notes and the booze doesnt show up in bite or warming.  Slightly dangerous, very big beer. This in enjoyable, but if you didnt like raspberries, you may not like it.  I enjoy them and grow my own each summer.  Glad to have tried this beer. Nov 17, 2023 Report",4.44

I have several different imperial stouts from Bottle Logic in my cellar, waiting for the review table and serving the beer at 50 degrees in a tulip glass. Pouring the liquid into the glass, it looks like 0-20W oil. The pour created a creamy two-fingered dark tan head with excellent retention. The slow dissipation left no lacing. The color is black, charting around SRM 38. Overall a near-perfect appearance for this stout with a high abv. Nosing the glass, I get bombarded with raspberries and bourbon; wow. Smelling the beer again, I detect caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, char, oak, oranges, fruity sweetness, coffee, and dark roasted bready malts. I love the way this beer smell. The raspberries are the star of the show. With the first sip, my mind has this supernova collision of flavor. I took another sip to ensure I was not lured by the siren song of drunk raspberries in an imperial stout. Alas, I was drifting away with flavor explosion on my palate. I taste boozy bourbon raspberries that are tarty, ripe, and juicy. The malty profile is roasted, bready, char, dark chocolate, espresso coffee, and caramel. Other flavors are fruity sweetness, oak, molasses, and a touch of oranges. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy, long, and pleasant. The body is heavy and has light carbonation. What an incredible beer. I have consumed a few raspberry beers of different styles, but I have yet to achieve this level of flavor. Bourbon-soaked raspberries in a bar of delicious dark chocolate and coffee-flavored beer are the best way to describe this—an absolute must-try for any dessert lover. May 27, 2023 Report",4.85

S - Strong coffee aroma with other interesting elements.  Knowing the name of the beer, I can imagine I detect the maple aroma, but I'm not sure if I would spot it blindly.  I can't identify the bacon.  Instead, it strikes me as spicy and smoky, reminding me of some beers I've had that were made with roasted chipotle peppers.  Either way, this aroma is a million miles deep and you want to dive in. T - The flavors are just have just as much depth as the aromas.  The coffee is there, but also sweet maple and coffee creamer and even a hint of smoke.  There is also a strong, sharp note that I can't place, but again my best guess would be some kind of pepper infusion. F - Medium to heavy body.  Strong carbonation.  Hops bitterness is also quite strong.  Alcohol presence is very low. O - This is a tremendously complex and interesting beer.  Every aspect of this feels like an Imperial porter, but it is lacking the alcohol to be that.  I'd love to see a version of this beer that had higher alcohol and cam in barrel aged editions.

That includes this beer, the imperial version of it, and the barrel aged version of it. These have been long time wants of mine (among ny first logged on BA), and I’m very excited to start off with this one, the 2nd highest rated American Porter on BA Pours almost completely pitch black with a finger of light tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing Wow, this is an incredibly aromatic beer, just so much maple and coffee. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple, medium roast coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla bean, smoky bacon, honey, and light caramel It’s definitely dropped off a bit in taste from where I’m sure it was in its prime, but I’m still digging it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting light roast coffee, salty bacon, dark bread, milk chocolate, caramel, light maple, and a touch of raisin. The swallow brings notes of smoky bacon, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, burnt caramel, vanilla, and roasted peanut A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet sharp beer. Finishes a tad sticky at first, but the smokiness dries it out like hell over time This one is absolutely wild. The bacon does more than I would’ve expected, but it can be a bit overpowering. I’m interested to see if the higher abv of the imperial version allows the flavors to integrate better Nov 05, 2022 Report",

That carries through to the taste, which is a delicate balance between the three named flavours, decorated with bits of cocoa and honey roasted almonds and other tasty treats. The maple is huge and genuine and constantly threatens to cloy but is always pulled back by the acidic coffee + woody bacon - it’s a lovely dance to behold. What’s absolutely crushing it here is that this is a regular strength porter: the body might be a bit heavy for that, but it’s definitely sweeter and less roasty than a stout, so it’s just plum crazy that this intensity of flavor comes at this ABV. If I have a quibble, this should be called Maple Coffee - the bacon is definitely in third place. Then again, that savoury meatiness peaking through occasionally adds a depth that brings this from very good to excellent. An easy sipper and a luxuriant classic. Aug 26, 2021 Report",

Smokey bacon flavors never really ""hit"" but end up lingering in the background more as you sip through. FEEL:  thinner body than expected.  A true porter and not tbe stout-porter mix that the appearance may have suggested.    Hypothesis is tbat the maple syrup tamps down carbonation and head, but doesn't really thicken the body. Very nice.  Comparing to memory of Wide Awake, this is right there with Aroma,  but falls shorter almost everywhere else.   Guessing the imperial porter treatment allowed for more body and hence more melding and retention of flavors. This one is still outstanding in its own right, and even more impressive considering it seems to be pretty available in South Florida. ** Jul 19, 2021 Report",4.58
Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,"Reviewed by BucBasil from Rwanda 4.5 /5 rDev +0.9% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5 Bought in Tampa, FL. Poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. A: The beer is a cloudy cola brown with a dark tan frothy head of 2-3 fingers with good retention. S: Smells like dessert. Heavy on the maple as if smelling a bottle of syrup. Bacon is of the candied sort and is just a light note in the nose. There is more cinnamon and a slightly roasted character. Vanilla, caramel. Biscuits or pancakes or pie crust. Like the smell of an IHOP when you open the door. A really good smelling beer, noticeable from a distance. T: Actually a strong smoked malt character comes out in front. The coffee really leads this, more like a vanilla latte than a roasted black coffee which was interesting. Then some smoked meat comes in, the idea of the bacon creeping in at the edges. It really comes in layers - next is the maple, like a side of pancakes, and a buttery malty character behind. For as strong as the maple was in the nose, this actually was lighter on the sweetness which was a pleasant surprise, and it's not at all cloying. F: The weakest aspect of the beer is it can be called that. A bit lighter feeling, but still coating. Overall: This is a really elevated porter. Drinkable yet unique. Dessert but not cloying. I'll definitely get this again if I see it. Jun 16, 2021 Report",
Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,"Reviewed by MacMalt from New Jersey 4.51 /5 rDev +1.1% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5 I received 2 bottles from @roguer in the NBS BIF #13. Poured into a stout glass at 54 degrees. It pours nearly ink black with a half finger of creamy, light mocha-colored head and a generous sheen of creamy lacing. Its fragrant nose features roasted malt, maple syrup, toffee, freshly-brewed coffee, and a whiff of molasses. Oh. wow! It's like eating pancakes with maple syrup and drinking a good cup of coffee in a favorite diner. It's nutty and roasty and the coffee provides an acidic bitterness that balances the sweetness of the maple syrup.  There are notes of toffee, fudge, tobacco, and earthy char. There's no real taste of bacon but the depth of the flavors trigger the imagination. What's truly amazing is the mouth feel. For a 6.4% Porter the mouth feel is amazingly thick and creamy. It's like drinking an imperial stout.  It's moderately carbonated and really drinks easily.  Overall, I now understand why so many BAs love this Porter. It causes sensory overload. Just superb!

Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,"Reviewed by SierraNevallagash from Maine 4.41 /5 rDev -1.1% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 A huge thanks to Nick for this one. You are far too generous. 355ml bottle - no date ('18 or '19 I'm sure) - poured into a balloon stem at 48°F. Pours a thin, mahogany brown with amber highlights, sitting basically black in the glass. When held to the light, the beer appears clear, deep garnet red, with micro suspended particulate. A finger of very light, foamy tan head forms, and recedes fairly quickly, leaving a nice collar. Nose: Compared to so many maple beers out there, two things stand out here. One, the maple is strong - balanced, not overpowering, but very forward. Two, the maple is very organic - like a pot with dark maple syrup reducing. Notes of maple fudge, chocolate chip pancakes, fresh, light roast coffee, and a very subtle smokiness underneath it all, that I would attribute to smoked malt. No bacon, but I could definitely see maple sausage. It really does smell like a chocolate chip pancake breakfast with coffee. Palate: The beer greets the palate porter-first. It isn't pastry, and constantly remains real beer. A very nice porter base, too - roasty, but lightly so, with very little malt sweetness, and no char to speak of. A touch nutty, with a bit of cocoa and toffee. The maple is ever-constant, lending a faint background sweetness, while the coffee stays restrained, tasting not like grounds, but a smooth lightly sweetened cup of light roast. The coffee note opens up towards the finish, as the maple slowly subsides, letting a bit of meaty emptiness come through. It isn't quite *bacon*, but it's a nice touch, and I can pretend. The finish is light coffee, subtle cocoa, a trailing hint of maple, and a kiss of smoke. Mouthfeel/Body: It's a 6.4% ABV porter. There's no reason to assume this will be thick or chewy, and it isn't. It's medium-bodied, fluid up front, but with some of that porter heft to it. It isn't thin, nor thick. It's right where it should be. Drinkable, not watery. Effervescence is medium - gentle, with fine, soft bubbles. Semi-sweet, with a moderately dry finish with lingering maltiness. An iota of stickiness. Overall: This takes everything that the breakfast stout has made famous, and delivers it in a smaller porter format. The maple is beautifully integrated, the coffee is top notch, albeit a bit restrained, and there's a nice subtle smoky element threading through. The porter itself is fantastic, with the perfect malt bill and great attenuation. It's bold, balanced, and deviates from the norm. All of the breakfast stout qualities in a smaller, drier, drinkable package. Simply put, it's really a great breakfast porter. Dec 18, 2020 Report",4.41

Despite living in Florida, I had never really dipped into much of Funky Buddha’s product beyond a couple of their standard year round offerings. The reviews for this beer are quite high, which is why I was so tremendously disappointed with it. Poured about 6 ounces into a glass, had about a quarter inch head. Clearly light bodied. Aromas were not terrible, mostly with maple. Taste was mostly maple, with some bacon and coffee notes of course. Feels rather carbonated. I honestly felt more like I was drinking a watery maple bacon soda than I was drinking a beer. My girlfriend loved it though, so I guess I’ll buy it for her going forward. Overall, it’s a mediocre beer at best. Certainly not worth the tremendous praise it receives. This seems to be a trend for me and their dark beer though, as I feel the same about two other highly rated offerings I tried on the same day. Was looking for a nice, robust porter with notes of maple, bacon, and coffee. What I got was a watery mess that I won’t drink again. Jul 09, 2020 Report",1.31
Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,"Reviewed by ovaltine from Indiana 4.6 /5 rDev +3.1% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 This is everything it says on the bottle - it’s definitely a porter (and a gorgeous one at that), with a body that verges in black with mahogany on the edges and a dense light tan head.  And the maple literally grabs you by the throat when you pop the top on the bottle - and then the coffee jumps in, and there’s an earthy salty note as well. The maple and coffee are the leads on the taste, but the star is the salty flavor that comes with some chocolate and char notes.  The mouthfeel approaches creamy, which is to style with this non-imperial porter. This may be the best beer I’ve had in 2020, and possibly back to 2019.  It’s breakfast in a beer, and is truly a pleasure to drink. Apr 10, 2020 Report",
Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,"Reviewed by Nuttin_but_the_best_Clark from Massachusetts 4.98 /5 rDev +11.7% look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5 This is the best beer I've ever had ... and this coming from an IPA guy. I bought a 4-pack on my way out of the brewery and tried my first one at a resort. I was on vacation, so my senses may have been slightly skewed but this is fantastic stuff, though not cheap. I tried about 5 or 6 beers on draft (not all full beers!) and purchased 3 beers to take home and this was the best, although the chocolate cherry cordial was close behind. The sweet sugary maple flavor hits you right away and then the bacon sort of creeps up on you. The coffee is an undernote, which is much appreciated. I find most coffee-based stouts go way over the top tasting more like week-old truck stop coffee forgotten and left in the pot for days. I love that the maple syrup and the bacon are the stars of the show and the coffee just kind of pops in like a sip of java here and there between breakfast bites. The beer mouthfeel is rather light but smooth and that scored it the only 4.75 ... it is brown-black and has a light head. As I was on vacation, I had no Tulip or Teku for this and instead used a stemless wine glass from the resort. Even still, the odor was a sweet and salty Umami blend ... you guessed it, maple syrup and bacon. I kick myself for not bringing more of this home in my luggage. This is the best tasting beer I've tried. If you are drinking for merely a buzz, probably not for you as I had two and did not feel much. Feb 22, 2020 Report",4.98

No hop character here and not really boozy anywhere. ONly 6.4% so that checks out. First sip reveals a medium to lighter body with fine, prickly carbonation.  Texture is very smooth. Flavor is dark chocolate and some roasted malts and then a big hit of candied coconut.  This coconut lingers after each sip as well.  I enjoy coconut in beers and am often let down, this one doesnt disappoint. There is no hop balance and again booze is absent.

The review below is an exact copy of my original RateBeer review from 11/22/2022. 12 oz. can, 6.4% ABV, Best by: FEB 2023 AROMA:  First hit with strong scent of coconut and then wisps of chocolate and coffee followed.  The coconut aroma overpowers just about everything else, and is a little odd as it does not smell like fresh coconut.  Instead, it smells more like coconut oil.  Which I find to be a little off-putting because it reminds me more of suntan lotion than something to ingest. APPEARANCE:  It pours an opaque black with a tall, dark-tan, foamy head that dissipates slowly with excellent lacing.  This is one delicious looking beer!! TASTE:  Initially it is moderately sweet with flavors of coffee and chocolate hitting first, followed by the coconut.  On the back end, the bitterness of the coffee starts to come through and then there is more coconut sweetness that fades away ever so slowly.  The flavors of coconut, chocolate, and coffee are much more evenly balanced than their aromas would hint at. MOUTHFEEL:  Full-bodied with a smooth and creamy texture, and average carbonation.  This is a luxurious feeling beer! OVERALL:  Other than my slight dislike of the coconut aroma, I can find little fault with this beer.

Last Snow,"Reviewed by pubscout from North Carolina 4.77 /5 rDev +7% look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75 A porter called “ Last Snow” from a Florida brewery (Funky Buddha) had to be interesting, but I never expected it to be exceptional. Revealing beautiful flashes of ruby and garnet when held up to a backlight, and a bouquet that is redolent of coffee, chocolate and coconut, it’s no surprise that one person declared it to be like a “liquefied Mounds Bar.” And that analogy remains relevant on the palate. A smooth mouthfeel and a sweetish finish produce a wonderfully crafted beer. Some have criticized the sweetness level, but I didn’t find it to be excessive. It’s a truly great dessert beer and one that’s on a par with another favorite of mine called Samoa This. And as it warms, it gets even more flavorful, making it a great choice for any Snow Birds in the Northeast who want to sip it in front of a roaring fire. That said, Last Snow is definitely not a session beer. One and done at one sitting would be my recommendation. But if you’re a fan of those flavors, you’d be wise to keep a sixer on hand...especially if you run out out Mounds bars. Jan 27, 2019 Report",4.77

Smells tasty, coconut, chocolate, roasty malts. Not getting much coffee. Taste is definitely coconut and roastiness. Getting vanilla as well. Lingering sweetness that reminds me of pipe tobacco. Nice full body for a porter, one thing that typically detracts from my enjoyment of the style is a thin body, not happening with this one.

Last Snow,"Reviewed by ThisWangsChung from Maryland 3.24 /5 rDev -27.4% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 3 The aroma is downright intoxicating when it comes to coconut qualities - this really does smell like a liquefied Mounds bar! Coffee, roasted malt, and (of course) dark chocolate all offer a nice ballast to the coconut. One niggle: the additions are so bold, they overpower the porter backbone somewhat. This beer is a total showstopper on the taste buds...well, at least for the first few sips. Apart from a slightly roasted opening, coconut utterly dominates in the best/worst way around the middle and end. Coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors, just like the aroma indicated. Speaking of how it ends, the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it - there's that ""so sweet, it's somehow bitter"" sensation I get from a select few dessert beers (like Creme Brulee from Southern Tier...or Maple Bacon Coffee Porter from Funky Buddha themselves!) At the end of the day, the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose. Plus, it feels thin and angular - not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness. Said extreme sweetness ultimately chokes the drinkability factor. Carbonation is medium high. I do enjoy this more than their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, but eh. I don't need to have this again either way. 3.24/5: Syrupy and absurdly sweet - perfect for the hypetrain crowd! Dec 16, 2018 Report",3.24

A 22 oz bottle capped and waxed (purple), 11.9% ABV. Brewed with honey and aged in oak barrels. Bottle Run #2/2014. Poured into a small-stemmed tulip. This beer was past its prime before I purchased it from Church Key. And they probably realized it as well. The carbonation on the palate was lacking and there was no viscosity to compensate. Spirits were not excessive but no depth, no complexity, not a good mouthfeel. This is one of those “what could have been beer.” 4.0 A – Pours black with a one-finger rocky brown head. Thin consistency, no viscosity in the pour. Decent carbonation. Some lacing and some minor legging. 4.0 S – Aromas of brown sugar, spirits, vanilla, and some spiciness with roasted maltiness in the background. The roastiness is secondary and almost hidden by the other aromas. 4.75 T – Roasted malts with some burnt malt bitterness. A good amount of spirits with a strong oak flavor. Very faint sweetness up front that fades very quickly. Also, dark fruits – raisin, dates, and prunes. 4.25 MF – Medium body with a semi-dry finish. Starts faintly sweet but ending with burnt malt bitterness. A flat mouthfeel. 3.25 Jul 24, 2021 Report",4.21

Rich, malty flavor dense with milk chocolate, oak, and bourbon; vanilla. Heavy body; dense and oily; chewy and sweet tempered with a nice whiskey warmth. I believe the aroma may have suffered some with five years of age, but the taste and mouthfeel really shine on this beer. The boozy character adds a nice balancing quality to the thick, rich sweetness of this imperial stout. I'm sure the honey greatly adds to the feel and taste. I must admit that this has been around for a few years, but at nearly $35.00 a pop, I wasn't too keen on taking a stab at this. In this case, I probably should have sucked it up and gone for it.

Picked up from Matt at Capone's at release. Cellared since then.  Been saving this from a mixed case full of Eclipse back in the day. Unsure if original or based on aging...but what I thought was going to be a powerhouse instead was a gentle sipper of immense complexity. Am I huge fan of Elijah Craig bourbon, and was delighted with its characteristic  enveloping vanilla, caramel sweetness and strains of resin from the barrel. The chocolate comes through in both nose and taste. Hints of citrus rind bitterness and molasses. Had an attractive color with dark brown an hints/sparks of ruby in the light. No residual head/lacing... as might be expected. No ABV and very smooth carbonation; very slightly syrupy. Enhancement not a concern.  Gentle sipper, seductively sweet and delicious. FWIW...agree with others..there are many many good BA Imp Stouts out there these days. And I also get worried when more that $1/oz.

Imperial Stout aged in Bourbon Barrels. Sustainably Crafted with Purpose. 13.2% ABV, Art by a symbol I can't quite make out beyond the letters K M. Brewed and bottled by Jackie O's Pub & Brewery, Athens, Ohio. Around the brewery, we listen to a lot of reggae, drink a fair share of coffee, and are devoted to our barrel aging program. In 2015, we had a one off imperial stout aging in barrels for close to a year. These barrels had a rich chocolate/vanilla character, but were asking for a boost. Stauf's coffee roasters in Columbus, Ohio nailed the perfect roast on some authentic Jamaican Blue Mountain  Coffee to compliment this Barrel-Aged Stout. The illustration on this label is of Charlie Ace's Swing-A-Ling Mobile Record Shack which was notorious for broadcasting the ""Champion Sound!"" our version does this with fresh grounds and good vibes all around!! Appearance: Slow poured into a large snifter. Light carbonation and a quick but soon goon burst of dark brown tan head that ends up leaving a tan ring forming above and around the rim of near black with dark brown base. Very thin small island of carbonation settling over about 5% of the base. 4.0 Aroma: Let this sit for about 15 minutes before diving in. Getting a strong dark roast coffee and pepper notes, the latter some may not enjoy but I enjoy in most instances including this selection. Not getting barrel or anything else from the base, either first attempt or throughout. Pretty much mega coffee, which I'm enjoying, but would have appreciated more depth. 4.0 Taste: Consistent with the aroma, coffee. coffee, coffee . Dark roast, lighter pepper. Sometimes age reduces the coffee, but I can't imagine how concentrated this would be if I popped open at the release. I gave it more time, and was getting a nice chocolate fudge backed by a nice vanilla which I see as overkill in many beers, but nicely balanced here. The aroma remains consistent, but will many BA stouts, let these sit a half hour for maximum enjoyment. 4.25 Mouthfeel: Creamy full body, carbonation very faint and gentle. This drinks strong from go, the non bourbon flavor isn't fooling anyone as this is strong like bull, as my Busia would say. It's also coffee, coffee, pepper, coffee with a bit of chocolate and vanilla slowly emerging later. Coffee very strong, especially a year plus from bottling, from start to strong dark roast flavorful coffee the entire finish. 4.25 Overall: This is a solid BA selection. I enjoyed this a lot. That said, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't really love coffee curbstomping most anything in its path. Really enjoying the coffee, wish I had some/more of the base and what the bourbon smelled or tasted of beyond adding strength. Coffee holds up real well, perhaps a bit too well. Final overall mark based on my personal enjoyment, and for this I enjoyed the overall experience on the coffee autobahn.  Thank you Dave! 4.25 Oct 20, 2024 Report",4.18

Aroma is rich with malt notes, roast coffee grounds and dark chocolate come through the strongest with roasted notes and definitely decent dose of coconut.  Scents are fairly balanced, but the coffee dominates the nose.  No hops here and the ABV is hidden as well. First sip reveals a rich smooth textured beer with medium to thick body.

Flavor is malt driven but not really sweet, I get dark chocolate and roasted malts, some rich bourbon notes and hints of brown sugar and the finish reveals some sweet coconut.

Real nice walnut brown nearly black body, with good reams of fine carbonation.  The head is a perfect tan light mocha settling at a nice little one fingers with a thin layer and lovely top. Delicious aroma.  An absolute wonderful balance of rich dark chocolate and vanilla.  Thick and velvet like sensing, with a rich hinting sense of cake like density.  Minimal coffee notes however, but still a fanstic sense of rich and controlled and barrel aging notes on the nose. Real fun palate.  Mid palate has just a touch of playful carbonation that cuts nicely, but luckily the body is full and thick to give a fantastic experience.  Rich dark chocolate, with a big cocoa powder note even with the light bitterness.  Slightly milky touches of vanilla, mostly in the finish.  The aftertaste does seem to hint of a faint touch of sour fruited coffee, but not off putting, and in a good way.  Still much of the coffee character seems buried in a rich chocolate/vanilla rush and a hinted fruit character no doubt from the heat and perhaps ground bean. Real impressive barrel aged stout, but my only issue is the coffee character is lacking, mostly in aroma.  It does seem to have impart some character, but not in the most expected ways.

One of my favorite true-crime podcasts has talked about this brewery; I have never consumed any of their beers. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 46 degrees. A dark tan airy one-fingered head with dismal retention. A hard pour could not create a proper head. The quick retention left nothing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 38, a used dark oily brown, nearly black. The appearance of the beer is okay; nothing spectacular stands out. Sad to see a hyped beer with a terrible debut. After I pried the cap off, a huge coffee aroma emitted. Nosing the beer, I detected molasses, oaky, char, caramel, toffee, dark roasted malts, toasted bread crust, leather, tobacco, alcohol, and earthiness. The barrel age permeates the beer, which is one of the primary aromas. The coffee flavors in the beer are quality. The coffee has this rich earthy, floral, leather, and some bitterness. Taking a few more sips, I tasted molasses, smokiness, char, oak, bourbon, oranges, tobacco, a hint of phenols, bready, caramel, toffee, raisins, and chocolate. The beer demands all your taste bud's attention. The mouthfeel is bitter, chewy, and warming. The body is heavy, has low carbonation, and has a long delightful finish. When I saw the terrible showing for the appearance, I got a little concerned. However, those concerns quickly evaporated. This is one monster of a beer in the nose and taste. The coffee is immense and flavorful. The heavy-handed barrel aging actually helped mellow the beer a bit. I loved this beer! Oct 21, 2021 Report",4.57

Hey, that was the right move because this is a great cup of coffee. No head, but some islands swirling around. Nose is amazing roasty coffee and charred oak barrel. First sips are wonderful gustatory representation of the olfactory sensation. Coffee flavor is dense, heavy, dirty in a good way. The bourbon barrel adds a nice cut to the coffee, along with a bit of vanilla sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and full, perfect for the way this tastes.

The head has a puffy texture and dies down somewhat quickly to a small ring at the edges. Lacing spotty and somewhat rare. S- Bourbon barrel comes on strong right away but once you dig a bit deeper the beer opens up wonderfully with the malts and the coffee. Chocolate comes to mind right off the bat and that is joined by some caramel from the malts that creates a nice brownie feel. Some nice peppery Bourbon whiskey that gives a bit of dark fruit feel. Suggests booze but that balances with everything else nicely. A lot of vanilla throughout this. Each element comes together in harmony. T- The barrel is a bit stronger here than in the aroma as far as the overall balance goes but good thing it is a really great barrel flavor. The whiskey, vanilla and softened oak burst onto the palate followed by rich chocolate, toasted nuts, charred barley, cocoa powder and dark roast coffee notes. A subtle smoky tobacco thing happening but secondary to the malts and barrel. Great balance of booze, sweetness and bitterness. MF- Medium bodied overall with a moderately low level of carbonation. The mouthfeel isn't bad but it does come off a bit more oily and slick from the high ABV and it loses some of the hefty creaminess. Ends slightly warm. I guess I have learned to trust Jackie O's with barrel aged brews over the years. A large dose of Bourbon barrel leads things off with coffee, roast grains, chocolate and vanilla notes also very strong. Nov 07, 2020 Report",4.36

I bought this a while ago in a bottle shop when it was too hot to enjoy a big barrel aged stout so now's the time.  Poured a 12.7 ounce bottle into a DFH tulip and the head just didn't measure up over a blackish brown body so it gets nicked for that.  Smell is of a generic brand Jackie O's stout, which is a pretty high standard but they have a certain sameness to them albeit on a high plane (I hope this is making sense to someone who's experienced this).  They loaded this up with Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee (which coffee wise is out of my not cheap range) so it's present in the smell and taste but not to an obnoxious degree; instead things are nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel is just fine for a barrel aged stout. This has been a good experience despite my lower than average scoring. Oct 31, 2020 Report",4.35

Oily and slick looking in the glass. A small, frothy, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and quickly dropped to a clingy color. Minimal lacing. The aroma was really interesting and complex. Caramel notes were most apparent initially. Some molasses came through as well. Sweet but definitely not excessively so. The coffee presence was very pleasant but a touch more subtle than I anticipated. Roasty espresso came to mind. Fragrant bourbon and vanilla notes married perfectly with the espresso. Later, the coffee intensified. The flavor profile was also very impressive. Big roasted malt notes on the front end. Espresso was came through as well. Bit of dark chocolate in the center. Bourbon notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate. Like in the nose, the bourbon lent the beer a fragrant, vanilla-like quality. More roast and booze on the back end and in the finish. Hint of lingering bitterness after the swallow. Terrific rich, creamy, fuller bodied mouthfeel. Slick, oily and smooth on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, fairly subtle effervescence that was spot-on for the style. Jackie O’s Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground is a fantastic beer that perfectly combines the roasty and boozy notes found in many old-school bourbon barrel-aged coffee stouts with the richness and sweetness typical of newer takes on the style. Even though this beer was first brewed in 2015, it still has relevancy today. Jul 24, 2020 Report",4.56

Reams of fine carbonation plentiful and lengthy, reaching to a foam forming superfine bubbled three to four finger off white head.  The head creation is one of the tiniest I have ever seen on an IPA, nearly nitrous looking out of the can.  Big classic retention and a cream top complete a near perfect look. Tea and caramel notes on the nose complete a balanced aroma on first exploration.  Soft herbs and a sweet hint of crispy caramel sweetness keep things solid.  Not so much hop forward at first but slowly revealst it's self.  There's some degree of exotic citrus and a unique sweetness that's hard to pinpoint.  It's a very unique and distinct old school hop angle it seems, but very impressive. Palate seem to be right on.  Classic hinting West coast like flavor, sorta?  but has a pine action East?.  Soft caramel with some pine and citrus action and an aftertaste that is very unique.  Creamy flavors in the mid palate with an excellent slow explosive heat of pine and astringency.

A: Slightly hazy light amber with prodigious 2-finger off-white frothy head with a pillow of foam laying on top and craggy thin stripes of lacing. A stunner for sure. S: Aromas of marijuana, lemongrass, leafy hop, black tea, and herbal honeysuckle dominate but leave plenty of room for some grapefruit and pineapple to sneak through. There are some lighter caramel notes as the beer warms. T: Flavor is excellent but isn’t as intense as many other DIPAs but has nice honeysuckle, herbal, marijuana, and tobacco flavors with some fruity grapefruit, pineapple, and pine resin. Light caramel malt flavors are light but apparent. Bitterness is moderate-high with low esters and mild cherry alcohol flavor. M: Dangerous medium body and very dry finish. O: Bodhi is a classic Midwestern DIPA with light caramel notes and herbal, dank, MJ hop character with milder fruity grapefruit and orange flavors. Intensity was a bit less than expected. Still a very good DIPA especially for those who love the dank. Aug 07, 2021 Report",4.31

One finger of off-white foam fizzes up top, dissipating quickly. Aroma is tart and abbreviated. It hits peach right up front, but it's soft. Stone, lemongrass, oak, green grapes, and grass all add some depth for a clean, playful smell. Flavor profile is delightful, with sweet peach right out front. Peach is mild, never commanding the lead. Accents of white wine, stone, faint pear, oak, and lemongrass establish the rest of the flavor profile. It starts out tart, leaning into sour at the end. It also finishes with a more acidic bite than the start. Mouth feel has a bubbly start, but soft finish. Thickness is medium. Overall, peach is really pleasant, and compliments the underlying beer well. It posses just enough tartness to tighten up the jaw, but not enough to wreck the palate.

I served it at 46 degrees. The pour created an airy, foamy, half-fingered, off-white head with poor retention. The color is light brown, with reddish hues, charting around S.R.M. 22. The beer is clear with bits of yeast floating. The dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The appearance is average for this style. The initial aromas are cherries, horse blankets, barnyard funkiness, and fruity sweetness. Swirling the glass a few times, I smell lightly toasted malt, acetic acid, berries, and yeasty and lightly toasted malts. The fruity aromas are intense and compete with the sourness of the beer. I thought this beer would have an intense sourness, yet the macerated berries mellow it out. I taste berries, lightly toasted malts, yeasty, barnyard, earthiness, and fruity sweetness. Well, balanced beer. The mouthfeel is tarty, finishing crisp. The body is medium with medium-plus carbonation. I have looked for this beer for quite a while. I found it a small town in Montana. This is an exquisite beer with bright, fruity flavors balanced with sourness. I am glad I picked this beer up. Dec 28, 2023 Report",

This review is mostly for my own personal interest, given the fact that it's like 3 years past due. Pours a foggy, reddish-burgundy colour with some flaky sediment that eventually settles at the base of the glass. Nearly an inch of bubbly, off white-tinted head dissipates within a matter of minutes; a thin collar is the only noticeable remnant. Potent aromas of cherry juice and raspberries, paired with hints of oak, baking spice, vanilla, cranberry and red grapes; restrained suggestions of balsamic vinegar and funk. A masterful fusion of sweet red fruit flavours and sour, oaked red ale notes - the cherry and raspberry come through first, joined by notes of cranberry and red grape shortly thereafter, making for a decidedly fruity forefront. Hints of oak, vanilla, baking spice and subtle balsamic acidity develop later on, with a touch of earthy funk lingering into an aftertaste of cherry pit, apples, oak and red fruits, especially cranberry. Medium-full in body, with moderate carbonation that feels gentle and frothy; smooth, soft mouthfeel. Normally these 750 mL bottles of Rodenbach are overkill for a single person, but CR is so easy drinking, and the abv is so well-integrated, that polishing it off should be no trouble at all. Final Grade: 4.35, an A grade. I honestly don't think Caractère Rouge is the #1 example of its style... however, there's a strong argument to be made that it's the best *introductory* Flemish red available. Its ample red fruit flavours add a prominent juicy-sweetness to the profile, counteracting the innate sour/funky qualities of the underlying red ale. It's also worth mentioning that the base ale itself is much less assertively acidic and funky than, say, Rodenbach's Grand Cru or their Vintage series, making for a more approachable & drinkable glass of beer (though perhaps not as complex). Still an excellent sour - likely not worth cellaring, but based on this experience a (properly stored) 5-6 y.o. bottle will hold up fine. Highly recommended. Sep 18, 2023 Report",4.35

Look: beautiful clear ruby red, but points subtracted for the visible sediment at the bottom of my half pour. Basically no head. No carbonation visible. Smell: red wine, dark and fruity and tart. Taste: Cherry changing to raspberry, with a sweetness that comes and goes. The cranberry appears most in the aftertaste.  Not as dry as my nose was expecting; in fact, it's pretty sweet. I took this out of the fridge but I'm not getting the complexity I hoped for. Feel: a little tingly even though I can't see any bubbles. Moderate mouthfeel, not particularly light or heavy. Overall: tasty and fun, good balance between tart and sweet, but I have to admit I was hoping for more. I have no idea how old this bottle is or how it has been stored.

But Caractere Rouge, I like. Note that only 2 of the 12 that I've had among the Top 100 Flanders Reds did I rate above each's BA average. As a malt-head, tart is OK. In the hands of a master, the style is better. In the hands of the masters of the masters that produce the style's finest, I have to agree with the high accolades awarded Caractere Rouge. Weakening my resistances to tart, Caractere uses more than cherries for its 6 month sit in fruit. I detect raspberries. Thus, Caractere is more of a fruit cocktail that how other brewers merely use malt to impart fun and bacteria to impart nature's art and barrels to impart complex flavors. If I were a sour-phile, I'd put Rodenbach on my BBBL list (Belgian Brewers Bucket List.)  The tour of their brew-room and barrel-room seems to have few rivals in the world. But, I think I'd like to have a nearby restaurant also because Rodenbach seems to know what the kitchen needs. I've just had Caractere with a simple meal of soup and potatoes. My simple meal was vastly improved by Caractere, a masterpiece. Jan 23, 2021 Report",4.51

Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"Reviewed by thebeers from Pennsylvania 4.21 /5 rDev -5.6% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25 Pours a hazed red with a brownish hue.  The fat finger of raspberry-tinted, light tan head quickly fizzes away to a wisp and a crown. The big, fruity aroma smells “pink,” with fresh, juicy berries, cherry, some solvent and light oak. More of the lovely vinegar acidity characteristic of Grand Cru shows up front in the taste, pairing nicely with the juicy cranberry, raspberry and cherry.  The oak touch is refined, smoothing out both the juice and acidity in the finish.  The aftertaste is only lightly puckering — a mixture of sweet and tart. Medium bodied at most with a slight oily slickness and light carbonation fizz. Almost shockingly juicy, while maintaining Rodenbach’s classic character.  Makes for a delicious special-occasion treat.

Best by 2/19/18, had 11/21/18.  Shame on me for missing by that much. Pours a purplish amber, cloudy, with a one inch foamy head and some foamy lacing.  Aromas of cherries, raspberries, some cranberries, malt, some vanilla.  The flavor is similar- cherries, raspberries, malt, some cranberries, light vanilla.  Not picking up the oak or caramel.  Lightly tart and sour, fairly sweet.  Smooth, a solid medium body, well carbonated. It’s all about the fruit and it’s very well executed.  The tartness of the cranberries is a nice balance to the sweetness of the cherries and raspberries.  Undoubtedly, missing the best by date by 9 months has had some  effect here.  Very enjoyable and well worth a purchase. Feb 13, 2020 Report",4.35

Smells absolutely intoxicating of vibrant, tart red berries and musty, old oak, with just a hint of tannins and vinegar coming through as well. Taste is a perfect balance of juicy, vibrant, sweet and tart red berry notes of cherry, raspberry and cranberry, with each really standing out on their own, and a strong barrel-character of earthy, old and slightly tannic oak, as well as some light, musty mushroom funk and just a hint of balsamic vinegar. Finishes quite tart, but not overwhelmingly so, with some vibrant red berries, musty oak and a touch of tannins and vinegar lingering in the aftertaste. Full, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/strong carbonation. A fantastic Flanders Red Ale that just showcases a perfect marriage of vibrant, fresh fruit and musty, old oak, with a perfect balance of sweet and tart notes and a wonderful richness and complexity added by some lighter, vinous, funky and acidic notes that all come together to form a sublime drinking experience. Also stands heads and shoulders above the way too sweet and one-dimensional Rodenbach Alexander thanks to a much richer and more well-balanced depth of flavor. Dec 22, 2019 Report",4.62

Best before date: 02/07/2020 I went into this so excited to try this beer.  The look was a beautiful dark pink colour, and it smelled like a great combination of berries.  That's where things went sour, literally.  I know that this type of ale is supposed to be tart, and I was expecting that.  Two other beer lovers tried this with me, and we all felt similarly.  It tasted like red wine that had gone to vinegar.  I have tasted balsamic vinegars that  I would prefer to sip.  I am hoping that I got a bad bottle, but I fear that it wasn't the case.  It felt like it was well-brewed, but the taste was frankly revolting, and I have had some bad brews in my day. 100% disappointed. Aug 25, 2019 Report",2.03

Taste has just a light touch of sourness from the cherries and a great balance of sweetness in the form of cherries and raspberries. Yeast and Belgian feel is so light and makes this beer so so drinkable at 7%abv. The tartness lays on the tip of the tongue and does not overpower the goodness of the main ingredients.

S: The first hit is green; grassy, slightly spicy, and resinous, which gives way to ripe tropical and stone fruit, juicy citrus, and light floral notes, held together with biscuity malt, caramel sweetness, and hints of vanilla. T: Big time ripe tropical and stone fruit, nectarine, apricot, mango, passion fruit, and hints of pineapple and lychee, ripe citrus, orange juice and a touch of lemon lime and grapefruit, floral notes, a bit grassy, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness with almost vanilla cream undertones on the finish. A super faint touch of alcohol can poke through on the finish as it warms. M: On the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation, creamy smooth, with the faintest touch of hop burn. O: Basically exactly what you'd hope for when you turn OH loose with Citra hops. Intense, yet smooth. I think the DDH Double Mosaic Daydream is my favorite of the series so far, but this is close behind. Jan 02, 2025 Report",4.44

Smell:  slightly dank, slightly grassy, with a hint of slightly sharp citrus hops.  Not bad, certainly, but not totally outstanding. Taste:  sweet malt helps this beer along, with a mild passionfruit character alongside a mild stone fruit character.  It’s juicy and tasty, if not, maybe, the brightest hazy IPA I’ve had.  It’s got a lot more going on than the aroma, though. Mouthfeel:  medium-rich body with a really good level of carboantion and creaminess.  Very nice. Overall:  a solid beer!

Murky and opaque but not quite turbid dull lemon body.  Kind of fleeting with a light lemon meringue pie custard look with a solid appearance.  Bright white creamy forming head of thee fingers, and lots of solid cling and chunky lacing. Bursting hop aroma.  Dank earth with sweet spice tones and mixing bold citrus flavors of hop all at once.  Dank orange peel madness is what it seems like in a can with a neutral malt presence to let everything shine.  There's a touch of sugar here as well on the nose. Kind of an interesting but unexpected experience.  Light bodied but flirting with a real sense of wet mouthfeel.  Rushing and very diverse hop flavors.  Tropical sensing pineapple, spiced up herbs, and a slight touch of sweet milk seems to rush on first sip.  Diversity still continues in the finish, pine and earth like richness with bitterness that mixes with a light touch of cream lactose for an added cut to the senses. Still overall it comes off as just really solid, even crushable, but not mind blowing. Sep 08, 2023 Report",4.22

Other Half made a deal with the devil! Seriously, this brewery can do no wrong. If you can get their beers, do it now, because this seems like something that can't last. AMBEV is going to buyout this brewery and start producing mediocre IPAs to capitalize on the brand while they can. If there's anything I've learned after half a century on this planet, it's that extreme excellence cannot endure in the mortal realm. Does the Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream match my previous Other Half favorite, Citra + Mosaic? I'd have to match them head-to-head to be sure, but I think it exceeds its predecessor. There's just a tiny touch of sweetness that elevates this hoppy masterpiece above C+M. Maybe. If you can put one of each in front of me, I'll let you know for sure, and thank you enthusiastically in the process. The worst Other Half ales would easily qualify as the best beers of many other brewers. That is not an exaggeration. I've been enjoying everything I've bought from them in the last six months, and the Daydream may be a new pinnacle. At this point, I should be giving you tasting notes and that kind of stuff. Nah. Just drink it yourself. It's a great NEIPA. Plato himself would call this a platonic NEIPA. Smooth. Citrusy. Smooth. Delicious.

Let's get into it Pours a hazy yellow gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing The nose is fruity and sweet, but still remains incredibly balanced overall. I'm picking up on aromas of mango sorbet, orange zest, papaya, doughy malt, grassy hops, jammy apricot, peach, light white pepper, and pineapple juice It unfortunately trends even sweeter in taste losing a bit of its edge, but it is still quite good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting peach rings, papaya, pineapple juice, doughy malt, orange marmalade, wildflower honey, light apricot, and raw oat. The swallow brings notes of papaya, orange zest, pineapple juice, lemon custard, bready malt, peppery hops, peach rings, light vanilla, and apricot A medium fully body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in as silky beer with a bit of a bite.

The honey is still a standout, lending a natural sweetness and floral aroma as a counterpoint to the base porter's roasted bitterness, and drying out the finish. The earthy, nutty coffee is less obvious on the nose but still shows up on the palate, alongside an obvious, but not dominating, bourbon and oak character from the barrel. Moderately full body with an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. Mar 27, 2018 Report",4.34

Poured from a 500mL bottle into a hill farmstead tulip. Purchased at the brewery. Pours a deep brown body with a nice, frothy three finger heads that reduces to a ring of foam and leaves spotty lacing. Aromas are very inviting, sweet bourbon, coffee, milk chocolate, honey, sweet vanilla. On the tongue it's pretty sweet, caramel and sweet milk chocolate, developing into vanilla and bourbon, chocolate cake, coffee. The finish is roasty and charred, a lightly bitter coffee / toasted malt flavor that sticks on the tongue for a while. Mouthfeel is rich but not too thick, sweet and decadent. Medium-low carbonation. A real winner from Hill Farmstead. This release is drinking great, complex yet balanced with tons of flavor and a good bourbon presence. Sep 30, 2017 Report",4.44

I’m starting to work my way up to the more acclaimed bottles he sent me now, this one hovering right below the top 250 at the moment. Let’s get into it Pours a very dark brown with a finger of reddish tan that that quickly fades to a ring and leave minimal lacing I’m gonna guess this bottle is getting a bit old since there’s not a ton of coffee in the nose, but it’s still good. I’m picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, sweet bourbon, raisin, vanilla bean, dry oak, medium roast coffee, and a touch of bell pepper Oh yeah, this has lost most of the coffee it once had. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, vanilla bean, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, caramel, and light raisin. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, earthy whiskey, vanilla bean, toasted oak, brown sugar, burnt caramel, and very faint coffee A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes slightly sticky and boozy This one was fine, just not amazing, but that’s definitely a function of age. I’d love to try it again fresh one day Jul 01, 2022 Report",4.06

L - Deep brown color like motor oil, with no light allowed through.  Medium brown colored head is thick and moussey when poured, like a dollop of brown whipped cream.  It fades slowly to a thick ring around the glass and massive sheets of lacing. S - Massive aromas of coffee and chocolate, backed up by strong roasted, almost burnt grains.  This version is not barrel aged, but there is enough alcohol aroma that blends with the other aromas to almost make you think there is whiskey in there. T - Espresso, chocolate, burnt grain, smoke.  Alcohol sweetness mid-palate, followed by an off-dry finish. F - Thick body with a silky, slightly oily feel.  Low to moderate carbonation.  Strong hops bitterness combines with burnt grain astringency.  Big alcohol presence, but not overly hot. O - This is a massive stout that still manages to show off subtle flavors and aromas.

It's not overly roasty, which is good in my opinion. Lots of toffee. I love the vanilla-forward flavor. Burnt caramel and molasses show up too. It's sweet but rich and roasty at the same time. M: Very thick and sticky. A little cloying but in a good way. That burnt caramel and coffee and vanilla linger around for a while. This beer is giving me coffee breath! O: So glad I found this! I almost didn't buy it because I didn't want an overly-roasted coffee flavored beer (this happened in the recent past -- $23 gone down the drain). Anyway, this lives up to the hype. It'll bring more than just a caffe americano flavor profile. I liken it to a coffee/vanilla-infused Marshall Zhukov -- has the same thickness and feel, and the base stout seems to bring just about the same flavors. Very impressed by this.

Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Reviewed by Roguer from Connecticut 4.59 /5 rDev +0.7% look: 3.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75 Very little head on the pour - although what it lacks in foam, it makes up for in aroma, as decadent notes of vanilla, toffee, and brown sugar leap from the pour itself. Up close, the impression is much the same, along with rich bourbon, chocolate, molasses, and espresso. It's incredibly rich and slightly intimidating - in the best of ways. The vanilla is present but not overpowering; the emphasis is on the marriage between the bourbon barrels and the base imperial stout. Thick and chewy on the palate. Alcohol presence is notable, but never quite harsh; it's a big beer, and it's not afraid to let you know (and the nearly two years in barrels certainly doesn't detract from the effervescent booziness). You can sip, sit, savor, and chew this one without ever reaching a point where it becomes too aggressive, yet it never loses at least a slight bite about the gums. Tasting notes are both surprising and expected. Yes, there's rich chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and bourbon, but there's also a slight sharpness from the oak and perhaps a more sour mash than some other bourbons which may run sweeter. The beer itself is moderately sweet, leaning toward dessert territory, but by no means cloying. Molasses, honeycomb, toffee, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, cherry, red grape, brown sugar, espresso. Feb 11, 2024 Report",4.59
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Reviewed by WunderLlama from Massachusetts 4.47 /5 rDev -2% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5 Brewers notes: Vanilla Bean Truth is an Imperial Stout aged for 22 months in select wheated bourbon barrels and then conditioned upon heaps of grade A, purposefully selected vanilla beans. It pours a viscous black color in the glass with a mocha-colored head. When poured cold, the flavor profile leads with chocolate wafer cookies, bourbon-vanilla heat, and rich dark chocolate. As it warms, the true complexity emerges. We taste and smell bourbon chocolate chip cookie dough, bourbon vanilla ice cream, tootsie rolls, and smooth chocolate syrup. The vanilla character does not overwhelm - the intent here is harmony and integration. The vanilla addition serves to soften the bourbon and chocolate character of the base beer making the whole presentation more confectionary and decadent like chocolate vanilla syrup. This is an immensely enjoyable beer that rewards the senses as it warms in the glass, revealing layer upon layer of complexity that is only possible to achieve with patience, time, and focused brewing attention. This beer will develop in the bottle for two years or more but is ready to enjoy now. We believe bottle development is best achieved while cold, and away from light. Removing this from my wants list …..500ml bottle purchased at Tree House Tewksbury, ranked #212 on the BA top 250, #25 on the BA American Imperial Syout list, # 42 in the top beer list of Massachusetts brews, …a list dominated by Tree House, paid $25  for this bottle.

Aromas on this are defined by complex flowery and spicy vanilla, bakers chocolate and lighter molasses among a well accentuated, toasty, oaken barrel. The beer’s mouthfeel is rich and decadent, smooth and heavy with a fitting lower carbonation, which manages to develop a late effervescence, leading to a pleasant refreshment. Tastes of milk chocolate, spicy molasses and toffee, together with a warming, weatherbeaten, yet elegant, sweet and flowery appearing barrel. Got an earthy coffee bean dry- and roastiness going on, gently balanced by lots of soothing whipped cream and chocolate cake. Finishes with a warming, sweet spiciness, lingering, licorice accompanied vanilla bean and more chocolate among an evenly spicy, yet toasty maintaining barrel dryness.

The dense, oily looking body was capped by a small film of coffee colored bubbles that quickly dissolved. A thin, lasting ringlet encircled the liquid. The aroma was a bit underwhelming initially but improved dramatically after a few minutes. Fresh vanilla bean came through strong. Good amount of sweet, sticky caramel and toffee pudding notes too. Moderate bourbon presence. As the beer warmed, both the bourbon and the vanilla really intensified. Dark fruits were also apparent. The flavor profile was just as impressive as the aroma. Super rich, malty and robust. Nice roasted and caramel malt presence on the front end. Loads of fresh vanilla bean too. Moderately sweet. Dark fruits were detectable in the center. Bit of chocolate fudge as well. Bourbon barrel notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate and intensified on the finish. More lingering boozy bourbon, vanilla and sweetness after the swallow. Outstanding mouthfeel. Rich, creamy and full bodied for the style. Super oily and dense on the palate. The liquid contained a finely bubbled, moderate effervescence that turned super frothy and smooth. After a few sips, the beer deposited a sticky film on my lips. Tree House’s Blend Two was a big disappointment, but Vanilla Bean Truth definitely lived up to the hype. The fresh vanilla bean notes were intense but not overwhelming, and the bourbon presence was punchy though not overly hot or boozy.

Dragonsaddle,"Reviewed by jrc1093 from Connecticut 4.15 /5 rDev -7.4% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 Canned on 9/30/20; consumed on 10/18/20 Pours a turbid mango-gold body topped with a rounded, fluffy two and a half fingers of white foam; excellent head retention leaves a mound of cap, a slight, frothy collar, and a moderate spread of soapy, spotty lacing around the walls of the glass. Aroma shows traces of resin as it opens, withholding overripe peach, papaya, hints of bready malt, and guava briefly as the bouquet develops; creamier tones of mango build, further accentuating guava, tangerine zest, and slight suggestions of peach and pink grapefruit over time; a lush, tropical bouquet with defined, hoppy edges. Taste offers lime sherbet upfront, a semi-tart introduction to what is eventually a touch piney over the mid-palate and effectively accented with peppery, pithy citrus zest; pineapple, bay leaf, and apricot zest show depth into the back end as overripe mango and sweet bready malts shine into the finish. Mouthfeel brings a medium body alongside a mild carbonation deferring to a significant creamy texture dominant into the mid-palate, where a prickly resin into the back end glides toward an increasingly slick, stiff, yet easy finish. A great entry into the NETIPA category, perpetuating in equal parts the tempered abrasion matched by the burly profile which can be found in this (sub-) style; a pointed alcohol presence, abundance of flavor, and creamy, weighted texture to tie it all together;  spectacularly consumable 11.5% ABV.

The beer pours a dark rich black coffee color with no light passing through the glass.  A dense creamy tan head foams up about 1 cm and fades to a sturdy edge layer soon after the pour and the thinnest of surface covering.  Aroma on this beer is dark fudge chocolate, some brown sugar and hits of bourbon with a good bit of sweetened coffee and a bit of molasses.  No hop character and not really boozy of fusol aroma.  all the nose matches up with the style. First sip reveals a fairly thick body with sticky texture that coats my lips after each sip. Very fine and gentle carbonation easily rolls across my palate.  Feels like a big imperial stout should. Flavor is dark fudge and chocolate, some sweetened coffee, molasses, hints of bourbon also show up.  A bit of sweet vanilla in there too.  Not boozy or hot though, even with the higher ABV.  I feel like I am getting earthy cinnamon on the finish each swallow.  Again, never any hop character on this flavor profile, similar to the nose. Beer is a big imperial stout with bourbon and coffee and drinks as such.  I am slightly amazed at the hidden booze.  Well worth the sampling! May 12, 2024 Report",4.45

The boozy barrel notes keep everything together very nicely. Feel: Full and thick. Rather creamy than syrupy. Very low carbonation. Overall: At first, the combination of rye, molasses and coffee didn't sound too promising to me as I'm not a big fan of any of the three flavors in my stouts.

Taste has brighter complexion with semi-sweet chocolate, raisin, and barrel is not as powerful, loses the rye and some earth tones, but still excellent.

Beer finishes dry and spicy and with a touch of boozy heat but the ABV is rather well-hidden.  Beer is easy to drink, deceptively so, has great balance as notes of sweetness, fruit and coffee are all there and seem even, and this beer is really worth trying. Dec 10, 2020 Report",4.15

It brings the craft of FO, the depth of Darkstar and just brings it up with the excellent coffee choices drawn from Mostra. Pre COVID... Bought a bottle earlier this year (February) from my “go to” Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. Outstanding amongst so many others for its inclination towards deep old ales while still bringing a huge base of a rich Imp Stout. Nose highlights the rye and coffee; while taste adds the barrel. Remarkably smooth but has a slight attractive carb brightness to elevate drink ability. The barrel comes across perfectly with wood, vanilla and hints ( not a sledgehammer) of Bourbon. The nose and flavor balance is wonderful. What’s makes this even more extraordinary is that at 13% it is NOT a powerhouse. So many super big IS’s seem to punch you... but this a gentle subtle sipper. Kudos to BL for this amazing ( can I say it??) sessionable BAIS. Nov 07, 2020 Report",4.85

Coffee is up front and delicious. Rye spice is there. A gentle bourbon touch throughout... baker's chocolate, molasses, and even some vanilla. Incredible taste. This is exactly what a bourbon barrel-aged coffee stout tastes like in my mind. Palate/Finish: Fairly thick, oily, slick. Smooth going down, very little alcohol burn, and what alcohol is there just enhances the flavors. The coffee and rye flavors just stick to your mouth and linger. I could see this benefiting from just a smidge more thickness, but it's really damn-near perfect already. Overall: Probably the best stout I've had to date. Perfect balance with the coffee, barrel, and other additives. I don't know how BL did it, but they did. Would LOVE to try this again. Oct 24, 2020 Report",

Best by March 9, 2025, per the stamp on the bottom of the can. This is a very long time want for me, one of those legendary beers I learned about when I first became a beer geek that did not then get distribution anywhere near Washington state. Poured into a shaker pint glass, this was a quickly chill-hazed orange-amber color, with a thick, rocky, beige colored head. Lots and lots of lace. Fruity and citrusy hop aroma up front, but there's a sizeable, sweet malt scent there as well. The flavor is hoppy up front, and is more complex than in the nose. Citrusy, grapefruity flavors vie with a strawberry-like stone fruit sweetness. Midway through, a sweet, caramel & bread like maltiness pushes through, along with some piney hop notes in the fadeout. Medium bodied, with a fairly oily mouth feel. I'd call this a typical Midwest attempt at a West Coast style double IPA. It's good, but it won't make me prefer it over the genuine article when I can find it. I've been wanting to try this one for a long, long time, and I'm glad to have done so, but I'm not exactly sure I will find myself wanting to try it again. Jan 04, 2025 Report",3.81

Feel is typical of a lager, runny. Overall it's alright, very bright and sunny feeling for a pretty high AVB IPA. Wasn't what I was expecting with a name like hopslam, thought it'd be more hoppy. I guess if it's like all citra hops and maybe orange peel flavoring that would explain it. Would not buy again. Dec 25, 2024 Report",3.44

Appearance:  medium orange hue with a moderate haze and a thick head of frothy ivory foam that sticks around a long time and leaves a chunky lace on the glass. Smell:  quite sweet with plenty of honey and a grassy, earthy hop aroma. Taste:  very sweet; the malt and the honey are almost sticky sweet.  Hops have a light fruitiness to them, or at least seem to when coupled with the massive sweetness.  Bitterness is moderate; honestly the hops are pretty mellow when compared with the sweetness.  Actually not too bad. Mouthfeel:  medium-rich body with a moderate carbonation and decent creaminess.  I would have expected a bit more smooth creaminess given this beer’s hugeness. Overall:  I like this beer’s flavor; it’s too sweet for my palate, to be sure, but I understand its charms.

Feel-  Full body, slightly below average carbonation, highly creamy, highly bitter, slightly mouth warming, highly astringent. Overall-  The medium amber color was the first indication this was going to be a malt forward beer.  The above average head retention and lacing helped to keep the look number at 4.  The bouquet was definitely malt forward with grapefruit as a strong secondary aroma.  The flavor was malt forward and pleasant right up until the astringency got in the way.  The flavor rating would definitely have been higher without the astringency. The feel with full body and high creaminess was outstanding, but the astringency once again held my rating down by overshadowing the positive attributes.  Overall this was a solid beer that was just too malt forward and astringent for my taste.  I bet fifteen years ago this beer would have been mind blowing, but now it’s fairly average amongst the enormous available options. Jan 08, 2024 Report",4.03

That’s not an honest way to distribute beer cause of environmental affects that make the beer lose its taste. The average rookie consumer will not be able to judge to buy the beer or not. My two six packs were poured out and 40 bucks went down the drain too. Bought in November with the carton saying best by January 24 th. Guess what the bottom of the can revealed? January 2036.

Firstly, the smell and taste is exactly what a West Coast Imperial IPA should taste like. The hops are complex and massive, but balanced with the malt and the sweetness. The overall taste is not like a 10% ABV beer, but tastes more like something that is 8%.

Perhaps I got a bad batch last time, but it just didn't have the flavor profile I'd expect from a beer that almost cracks the top 250. The honey seemed to reduce the supposed ""Hopslam"" down to more of a ""hop nudge"". This meant any flavor complexity seemed to disappear as well. In this case, I think the high ABV is also detrimental as it tastes very alcoholic, and therefore heavy. Too bad, 'cause it's a heck of a value at Costco. Jan 09, 2023 Report",3.48

Look is fairly clear burnt orange/amber color with a foamy ivory head that takes a while to fall to a nice cap. Sits pretty still in the glass. Smell is pine, melon, caramel apple. Aroma is present but not powerful. Taste is pretty sweet up front with a hit of cantaloupe and citrus. Middle gets a shot of bitterness, but nothing too bracing. Middle sees more fruit flavor like apple and citrus. A bit of pine hits in the finish but it's balanced by a floral, honey sweetness. Balance is a key characteristic here. Aftertaste is apples, caramel and honey. Feel is medium bodied and smooth, smooth, smooth. A low carbonation pops up, but boy this is easy to drink. Overall, I should have tried this years ago, but balked at the price. This is tasty, balanced pretty well between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Way too easy to drink given the 10% abv.

Deep amber color, transparent with reasonable chill haze and a firm, persistent 1/2 inch head of creamy tan foam that left full curtains of lace. Aroma is a mix of rich malt and hints of woodsy hops. Sweet, caramel and honey nose with subtle pine and citrus hop notes are a welcoming indicator of the flavors to follow. Rich and yummy malt flavors wrap around the conifer and leathery hop resins in terrific balance.  Honey character comes through and the body leans towards a honey like texture and mouth feel.  Okay, Not honey thick but your do feel the beer hug your tongue, leaving a slick, sweet coating allowing that depth of flavor to linger.... honey-like. Hop bitterness comes in at the finish with a long and smoldering hop/pepper burn as the honey-malt dance twirls off stage. Alcohol is always perceptible but never gets in the way or is in any way harsh.

There's a subtly about the scents. Definitely the sweetness is from both the malts and honey. The citrussy floral notes are obviously from the slamming hops. Sweetness is the first taste that occurs as it hits the palet but then really nice hoppy bitterness. It's thin and has medium foamy carbonation. The finish is bitter, floral and sweet initially incredibly balanced but everything else fades and the bitterness remains drawing out for some time. Overall it's such an extremely good DIPA. The hops are very strong but the sweetness of the malts and honey balance it out so instead of being extreme it's incredibly refreshing. One of my favorite DIPAs, it has an originality to it.

A pint can could be completely emptied into a clear glass liter mug comfortably, with much room to spare. Unlike too many modern American IPAs, the pour produced no excessive stark white foam, even at room temperature. Instead, there's a very modest off-white head on top of a fully colored orange-amber liquid. It's opaque, but more bright than dull. The aroma is of sweet grains and some hops that don't seem to be overly fruity, nor overly piney. Some scent of alcohol hits the nose, but the aroma is balanced. To taste, it runs a little sweetly, in a caramel or butterscotch way. But, there's enough balanced hopping to compensate. The mouthfeel is remarkably rich and smooth, this is halfway down the esophagus before the high ABV gets noticed. Yet, the finish is clean and likely abetted by the alcohol, rather dry. Overall, this is one good Imperial New England IPA, almost to the point of being dangerous, even without any glass lacing to stare at. Apr 20, 2025 Report",4.22

Brewers Notes: Our very first IPA brewed back in 2013 was eponymously named after the street we called home: Congress Street. Its success inspired an entire series of beers, each of which used the same base recipe featuring a different dry hop presenting a unique flavor with common ties. Naming each one of these beers after separate streets in the Fort Point created a unique bond to the neighborhood we are proud to call home. Even as we grow and explore, the Street Series will always have a special connection to our roots. The culmination of all our Street beers over the past years, The Streets is a Triple IPA brewed to celebrate our anniversary. Using the same base recipe and bumping the ABV up to 10.6%, we dry hopped with Amarillo, Mosaic, Galaxy, El Dorado, Simcoe, Nelson, Vic Secret, & Enigma. Additionally, as a nod to the neighborhood, we also added Citra to the dry hop this year, the signature hop used for our Fort Point Pale Ale Heavily hazy and orange in appearance, The Street offers a nose rich with aromas of candied peach, tropical fruit, lime zest, pineapple and melon rind. These notes extend right through to the palate with complimentary flavors ripe apricot, orange peel, and white wine. Subtly sweet with a balancing floral bitterness, The Street has a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that rounds out this drinkable Triple IPA.

The deepest, murkiest pour I've seen in awhile. Love it. Tall, fluffy, creamy cap of white standing about 3 fingers, receding to 1 and leaving tons of creamy lace behind. Aroma brings a lot of alcohol heat, but more importantly - tons of juicy citrus fruit - grapefruits, oranges, sweet lemon juice and tangerine; some pineapple and mango and papaya; slight dank stickiness. Flavor is just huge - tons of papaya and mango with following fruits of grapefruit, tangerine, and orange. My can has a bit more alcohol heat than I'd like, it burns the flavors a bit; it finishes on grass and lime. Feel is juicy with spikey carbonation that dances around and stabs the tongue and forms into a nice popping creaminess on the back. Lots of alcohol heat. Moderate resins on the finish. Overall, if they can hide the heat a little better, this beer would be in my top 20 easily. Really good stuff, amazing as always from Trillium. Really glad I got to try this.

Emerald Grouper,"Reviewed by BEERchitect from Kentucky 4.25 /5 rDev -4.7% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25 Unlocking the mystery of how to avoid a cease and diciest letter because of beer naming rights, Pipeworks and Four Hands brewers find a solution: ""color + animal"" should do the trick. Pale gold, glowing translucently through a reasonable haze, Emerald Grouper builds a frothy white cap before teasing the nose with a flood of Simcoe, Citra, Galaxy and Mosaic hops and their tropical, citrus, dank and herbal glory. As a mild mannered sweetness of honey, caramel and toasted grains apply a granola effect on the early palate, the early palate shows a malty-sweet tone. But those hops are not to be denied. As the malts slowly dissolve on the middle palate, the flavors of grapefruit, orange, passionfruit, mango, apricot and lime all begin to shine in a fruit cocktail medley. With a light linger of malts having the fruity hop impressions seeming plump and ripe, the juicy session soon trends herbal, bitter and spicy. With a bitter finish, the session is piney, resinous, hemp-like and grassy. Full bodied and finishing malty-dry, the ale is a throwback Imperial IPA balance with a few modern tricks and adaptations. Its a great beer that lingers with an afterglow of hemp, peppery warmth and fruit peels. Mar 17, 2023 Report",4.25

Emerald Grouper,"Reviewed by TedHead from Illinois 4.4 /5 rDev -1.3% look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5 This one pours a slightly lighter than honey golden with a fluffy white head. It smells like sweet citrus with hints of tropical fruit and pine underneath it. The taste has a nice citrus forward start that smooths out into a mango pineapple flavor with a satisfying piney finish. The finish is much less bitter than I typically like, but it's very well done. It's very sweet without being overbearing. It's surprisingly refreshing for a double IPA and is a very easy one to drink. This one is something that would satisfy your serious craft beer palate, but also be something drinkable to someone just getting into the sport. Aug 08, 2021 Report",

Pours a very slightly hazy darker yellow-orange color with some fluffy white head and small rings of lingering lacing.  Big aromas of ripe grapefruit, mango, orange, lemon, pineapple and also some malt, vanilla, weaker floral hops and faint piney hops.  Taste follows the nose, excellent flavor and balance, good depth, higher ABV was fairly well hidden although there was definitely a little warming alcohol as the beer warmed.

Emerald Grouper,"Reviewed by Holderness from Massachusetts 3.44 /5 rDev -22.9% look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.5 Canned 3 weeks ago. L -- Golden straw body with near total clarity and two fingers of solid white head produced with moderate pour. Good retention and some lacing S -- Candied citrus peel, sickly sweet floral, honey, lime zest. Has this odd 'off' smell, almost like a compost pile T -- The added honey is definitely apparent here, lending both a sweetness and a fruity/floral character. Mostly green, leafy notes from the citra hops. Again, there is this weird sour/zesty note that is a little offputting F -- Medium mouthfeel, medium carb. Fluffy and fairly easy drinking O -- Not my favorite from Pipeworks, but I might be spoiled by Trillium's Cutting Tiles variants in terms of higher-ABV IPAs with honey added 69/100 Jun 03, 2020 Report",3.44

Pours fairly hazy deep golden amber/light orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish.

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp finishing. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-plus carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mild increasing warmth of 9.5% After the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; dangerously smooth and easy to drink for the big ABV, with the moderately bitter/resinous/drying finish; not overly aggressive. Amazing Simcoe, Citra, Galaxy and Mosaic profile. Extremely vibrant, juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a nice sized honey and bready malt backbone. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp resin dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. Loved the hop profile as expected. Oct 30, 2019 Report",4.23

Just a touch of booze on the finish so you know what you’re drinking. F: Medium weight with moderate carbonation, sweet to off-dry, a good side of syrupy.

Emerald Grouper,"Reviewed by Ego from New Jersey 4.05 /5 rDev -9.2% look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25 eyes... massive carbonation erupts from this even on a careful pour, I mean seriously this is bubbling like a muddy hot spring, this has lead to three fingers (easy) of white head with no signs of slowing down, color wise this goes down the yellow brick road (sans the lollipop guild or flying monkeys), not the usual color but that's ok, impressive hat on this one, and clingy like those annoying nettles that you get all over your socks when hiking in the Catskills (NY) nose... lemon spritzer, tropical leaning toward mango, definitely sense the honey (honey has a sort of 'dark' sweetness, ya know?), solid but nothing bowling me over taste etc... carbonation remains ample (sometimes on fizz bombs like this the fizz fades away quicker than the Baltimore Orioles since the 80s), drinks very light to medium, good mouth feeling, kind of rolls around the mouth well, very little alcohol detected but warms ya' down below, some astringent bitters that remind me of DFH 60, the mango quotient is thankfully low (I am not a fan of the trend of over the top juicy fruit hops tones, that's just me), real easy drinking, lacking a littl punch? OK, that's fair verdict? I have to say actual grouper is one of my faves to catch and eat when I am fishing in the Florida Keys (Islamorada)... but I digress, very nice offering here, well balanced, not as heavy as some DIPAs but it does have a little kick, mild compared to some... but that's ok, good beer May 07, 2019 Report",4.05

The color of the body is not that appealing but I love a lacey beer. Aromas of sweet ruby red grapefruit, sweet citrus, candy sweetness. Flavors are all citrus, grapefruit, guava, peach gummies at the finish. No heat, burn or harshness. Good balance of sweet and bitter without going overboard on either end.
